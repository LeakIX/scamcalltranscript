[00:15:03 -> 00:15:14]  You are going to get a text on your cell phone.
[00:15:14 -> 00:15:14]  Just have a look.
[00:15:14 -> 00:15:15]  Have you received any text?
[00:15:16 -> 00:15:17]  Just have a look.
[00:15:17 -> 00:15:19]  Have you received any text?
[00:15:25 -> 00:15:26]  I don't know how.
[00:15:26 -> 00:15:27]  I got a flip phone.
[00:15:27 -> 00:15:29]  I don't have one of them big flat phones.
[00:15:30 -> 00:15:35]  No, no, on your end, you are going to get a text on your cell phone.
[00:15:35 -> 00:15:36]  Just have a look.
[00:15:36 -> 00:15:38]  You got a text on your cell phone.
[00:15:38 -> 00:15:39]  Oh, okay.
[00:15:39 -> 00:15:41]  It says there, enter verification code.
[00:15:45 -> 00:15:46]  I'm looking for my...
[00:15:48 -> 00:15:51]  I don't see it.
[00:15:58 -> 00:16:02]  It says re-text the verification code and re-render the code verification.
[00:16:03 -> 00:16:04]  Verify another voice.
[00:16:10 -> 00:16:11]  I'm lost.
[00:16:12 -> 00:16:14]  I don't know what to do.
[00:16:14 -> 00:16:16]  You don't need to do anything.
[00:16:16 -> 00:16:17]  Put me on your speaker.
[00:16:18 -> 00:16:21]  And you have received a text on your cell phone.
[00:16:23 -> 00:16:27]  Just a minute.
[00:16:32 -> 00:16:36]  Are you there yet?
[00:16:37 -> 00:16:38]  Yes, I am here.
[00:16:39 -> 00:16:41]  I can't.
[00:16:41 -> 00:16:49]  I don't know how to set this stupid thing for, for um, um, now I'm getting tongue-tied too.
[00:16:50 -> 00:16:53]  Oh, relax, relax, relax.
[00:16:55 -> 00:17:03]  Um, okay.
[00:17:03 -> 00:17:10]  I want to, I want to put it on speaker.
[00:17:10 -> 00:17:12]  Now how do I normally put it on speaker?
[00:17:13 -> 00:17:16]  Oh, are you there?
[00:17:17 -> 00:17:18]  Mm-hmm.
[00:17:19 -> 00:17:20]  Oh, okay.
[00:17:20 -> 00:17:29]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:17:29 -> 00:17:30]  Oh, okay.
[00:17:30 -> 00:17:31]  Can you hear me yet?
[00:17:32 -> 00:17:33]  Yes, yes.
[00:17:34 -> 00:17:36]  Oh, well, you're not coming in any louder.
[00:17:36 -> 00:17:38]  That's like, I can't figure it out.
[00:17:38 -> 00:17:40]  So let's go.
[00:17:42 -> 00:17:43]  Verification code.
[00:17:45 -> 00:17:46]  It's blinking.
[00:17:47 -> 00:17:48]  What do you want there?
[00:17:48 -> 00:17:50]  Just look at your cell phone.
[00:17:50 -> 00:17:53]  You have received a text on your cell phone.
[00:17:56 -> 00:17:59]  I can't find it on my cell phone.
[00:17:59 -> 00:18:01]  That's what I'm trying to tell you.
[00:18:01 -> 00:18:03]  I don't know how to find it.
[00:18:05 -> 00:18:06]  I've got a screen.
[00:18:06 -> 00:18:07]  It's got your phone number on it.
[00:18:07 -> 00:18:08]  That's it.
[00:18:09 -> 00:18:10]  Swipe your screen.
[00:18:10 -> 00:18:12]  What kind of cell phone you are having right now?
[00:18:14 -> 00:18:15]  I've got a flip phone.
[00:18:15 -> 00:18:23]  A smartphone?
[00:18:23 -> 00:18:23]  No.
[00:18:23 -> 00:18:26]  Not a smartphone, right?
[00:18:28 -> 00:18:30]  It's just the...
[00:18:30 -> 00:18:36]  It's just the speaker is turned on.
[00:18:36 -> 00:18:41]  Okay.
[00:18:41 -> 00:18:43]  But I can't hear you any louder.
[00:18:44 -> 00:18:44]  Okay.
[00:18:46 -> 00:18:46]  There.
[00:18:46 -> 00:18:47]  That's better.
[00:18:49 -> 00:18:49]  Okay.
[00:19:25 -> 00:19:26]  Write down the password.
[00:19:31 -> 00:19:44]  I'm hoping this is it.
[00:19:44 -> 00:19:55]  Try that.
[00:19:55 -> 00:19:55]  Yes.
[00:19:55 -> 00:19:56]  I'm here.
[00:19:56 -> 00:20:41]  Write down the password once again.
[00:20:41 -> 00:20:42]  Okay.
[00:20:42 -> 00:20:55]  Okay.
[00:20:55 -> 00:20:56]  Just look.
[00:20:56 -> 00:21:00]  The password is correct.
[00:21:00 -> 00:21:01]  Yes.
[00:21:02 -> 00:21:06]  Playground.
[00:21:06 -> 00:21:06]  Yes.
[00:21:06 -> 00:22:33]  Write down your email address.
[00:22:33 -> 00:22:36]  Okay.
[00:22:36 -> 00:22:38]  Write down your password once again.
[00:22:38 -> 00:22:40]  Write down the password once again.
[00:22:40 -> 00:22:46]  You are here.
[00:22:48 -> 00:22:49]  Write down the password.
[00:22:49 -> 00:22:49]  Password.
[00:22:49 -> 00:22:50]  Password.
[00:22:50 -> 00:22:51]  What?
[00:22:52 -> 00:22:52]  Your name.
[00:23:00 -> 00:23:18]  Write down the email.
[00:23:26 -> 00:23:27]  Write down the email.
[00:23:27 -> 00:23:28]  Here you are.
[00:24:34 -> 00:24:34]  **redacted**.
[00:24:34 -> 00:24:41]  Sir, can you see this info doesn't match?
[00:24:42 -> 00:24:43]  Can you see that?
[00:25:03 -> 00:25:21]  Okay.
[00:25:21 -> 00:25:22]  Once again, write down your email.
[00:25:45 -> 00:25:46]  Write down the password.
[00:26:03 -> 00:26:46]  Okay, sir.
[00:26:46 -> 00:26:49]  I just got your point why you are facing this kind of problem.
[00:26:49 -> 00:26:52]  It's a matter of a virus.
[00:26:52 -> 00:26:55]  Can you see suspicious software block?
[00:26:55 -> 00:26:56]  Can you see that?
[00:26:58 -> 00:26:58]  Yes.
[00:27:00 -> 00:27:03]  You have lots of virus in your computer.
[00:27:03 -> 00:27:09]  That's why the virus is interrupting you to use your computer to open up your email.
[00:27:09 -> 00:27:14]  I'm just going to show you how many virus do you have in your computer
[00:27:14 -> 00:27:20]  so that once we are going to know how many virus do you have
[00:27:20 -> 00:27:25]  so that we are going to start the scanning and we are going to kick them out
[00:27:25 -> 00:27:31]  so that everything is going to be fixed.
[00:27:31 -> 00:27:32]  You might get it.
[00:27:32 -> 00:27:33]  I didn't know I had that.
[00:27:34 -> 00:27:44]  What do you see right now?
[00:27:47 -> 00:27:52]  There are straight up events.
[00:27:52 -> 00:27:56]  Can you see yellow warning, red warning, red error, yellow error?
[00:27:56 -> 00:27:57]  Oh yes.
[00:28:01 -> 00:28:03]  And at the very top, can you see number of events?
[00:28:07 -> 00:28:11]  Um, yes, 10,841.
[00:28:12 -> 00:28:15]  You have 10,000 virus in your computer.
[00:28:24 -> 00:28:26]  My computer is sick.
[00:28:27 -> 00:28:29]  Exactly, very badly.
[00:28:32 -> 00:28:34]  Well, I didn't realize I had that many on there.
[00:28:35 -> 00:28:41]  Didn't realize I had any on there.
[00:28:41 -> 00:28:42]  Okay.
[00:28:42 -> 00:28:42]  Okay.
[00:28:44 -> 00:28:48]  What I'm going to do, I'm going to give you the anti-virus scan in your computer.
[00:28:49 -> 00:28:53]  So that virus is going to be kicked out and you can use your email.
[00:28:53 -> 00:29:13]  Can you see the scanning is going on?
[00:29:15 -> 00:29:31]  Yes, I can.
[00:29:31 -> 00:29:31]  Okay.
[00:29:31 -> 00:29:48]  And what do you see right now?
[00:29:48 -> 00:29:49]  Black screen.
[00:29:54 -> 00:29:56]  There's a black screen on my desktop.
[00:29:58 -> 00:29:58]  Okay.
[00:29:58 -> 00:30:13]  It's asking for my command prompt and that's what you're doing.
[00:30:19 -> 00:30:20]  Oh.
[00:31:29 -> 00:31:32]  Yes.
[00:31:32 -> 00:31:34]  What happened, sir?
[00:31:34 -> 00:31:37]  What happened?
[00:31:57 -> 00:31:57]  Yeah.
[00:32:09 -> 00:32:55]  What do you see?
[00:32:55 -> 00:33:00]  Um, black screen with a bunch of white letters on it.
[00:33:01 -> 00:33:07]  Okay, just read out the last line for me.
[00:33:07 -> 00:33:12]  Please log in your bank to verify.
[00:33:14 -> 00:33:15]  Okay, over there.
[00:33:15 -> 00:33:16]  What else do you see?
[00:33:18 -> 00:33:20]  Like, read out everything from the beginning.
[00:33:22 -> 00:33:23]  What?
[00:33:24 -> 00:33:25]  Sorry, I beg your pardon.
[00:33:25 -> 00:33:25]  Do that again.
[00:33:27 -> 00:33:30]  I beg your pardon?
[00:33:30 -> 00:33:35]  Um, on that last line.
[00:33:35 -> 00:33:45]  Okay, over there.
[00:33:45 -> 00:33:47]  Can you see we have charged you,
[00:33:47 -> 00:33:49]  we have charged you $250 for,
[00:33:50 -> 00:33:51]  from your checking account.
[00:33:51 -> 00:33:52]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[00:33:52 -> 00:33:53]  They have charged you,
[00:33:53 -> 00:33:56]  like Geek Squad have charged you $250.
[00:33:56 -> 00:33:59]  Like, as I am trying to fix your problem.
[00:34:00 -> 00:34:01]  So by mistakenly,
[00:34:01 -> 00:34:05]  they have charged you $250 from your checking account.
[00:34:05 -> 00:34:07]  And can you see over there,
[00:34:07 -> 00:34:09]  something is written like it says,
[00:34:09 -> 00:34:10]  please log in your bank to verify.
[00:34:17 -> 00:34:20]  No, I'm not going to log into my bank account.
[00:34:20 -> 00:34:24]  No, no, no, I'm not telling you to log in, sir.
[00:34:24 -> 00:34:25]  I'm asking you over there.
[00:34:25 -> 00:34:26]  Can you see it says,
[00:34:27 -> 00:34:28]  like, please log in.
[00:34:28 -> 00:34:29]  Don't log in right now.
[00:34:29 -> 00:34:29]  What I am going to do,
[00:34:29 -> 00:34:31]  what I am going to do right now,
[00:34:32 -> 00:34:34]  as they have charged you mistakenly,
[00:34:34 -> 00:34:35]  what I am going to do,

[00:34:38 -> 00:34:40]  so that you can fill it out
[00:34:40 -> 00:34:42]  and you can get that money back.
[00:34:42 -> 00:34:42]  Okay.
[00:34:42 -> 00:34:45]  We don't want to keep your money in our pocket.
[00:34:45 -> 00:34:46]  It's your hard-earned money.
[00:34:46 -> 00:34:47]  We need to give you back.
[00:34:49 -> 00:34:50]  Hey, we're talking to you.
[00:34:50 -> 00:34:51]  It's mother.
[00:34:51 -> 00:34:52]  Do you have to be quiet?
[00:34:52 -> 00:34:54]  That's the deep quiet.
[00:34:54 -> 00:34:55]  I don't believe it.
[00:34:56 -> 00:34:59]  Yeah, I've been talking to you
[00:34:59 -> 00:35:01]  for 10 years and gone.
[00:35:02 -> 00:35:04]  Now, what did you want me to do here?
[00:35:04 -> 00:35:09]  You know that we have charged you $50
[00:35:09 -> 00:35:10]  by mistakenly.
[00:35:10 -> 00:35:13]  So you need to get a refund from us.
[00:35:14 -> 00:35:15]  All right.
[00:35:16 -> 00:35:17]  So type down.

[00:35:19 -> 00:35:19]  Geek Squad.

[00:35:22 -> 00:35:23]  Yeah.
[00:35:25 -> 00:35:26]  Taxi has left.
[00:35:27 -> 00:35:28]  Taxi has left on the road.
[00:35:30 -> 00:35:31]  Write down.
[00:35:31 -> 00:35:32]  Can you see refund form?
[00:35:32 -> 00:35:36]  You need to fill this form out.

[00:36:53 -> 00:37:21]  Go for the next one.
[00:37:21 -> 00:37:23]  Oops.
[00:37:23 -> 00:37:24]  It didn't go.
[00:37:24 -> 00:37:24]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:27 -> 00:37:33]  Go for the next one.

[00:39:06 -> 00:39:09]  Please, man.
[00:39:09 -> 00:39:15]  I have to get a refund.
[00:39:15 -> 00:39:15]  Yes.
[00:39:15 -> 00:39:20]  Refund amount.

[00:39:32 -> 00:39:33]  250.
[00:39:34 -> 00:39:36]  Who took that money out of my account?
[00:39:36 -> 00:39:37]  Huh?
[00:39:37 -> 00:39:37]  It's 3,000.
[00:39:37 -> 00:39:38]  Gixx Squad.
[00:39:39 -> 00:39:40]  Gixx Squad.
[00:39:40 -> 00:39:40]  Okay.
[00:39:42 -> 00:39:43]  It was a mistake.
[00:39:44 -> 00:39:52]  That's why we are sending that money back to you.
[00:39:52 -> 00:39:58]  Bank name, mother.
[00:39:58 -> 00:39:59]  Mother.
[00:40:17 -> 00:40:19]  Can you please tell me your name?
[00:40:19 -> 00:40:19]  Yeah.
[00:40:19 -> 00:40:29]  Okay.

[00:41:18 -> 00:41:19]  It's on phone.
[00:41:20 -> 00:41:21]  Uh-huh.
[00:41:21 -> 00:41:25]  So this money has been sent.
[00:41:29 -> 00:41:31]  We're not authorizing the transfer.
[00:41:31 -> 00:41:32]  Ma.
[00:41:32 -> 00:41:35]  They already took it out.
[00:41:35 -> 00:41:36]  Okay, mother.
[00:41:36 -> 00:41:37]  Authorize it.
[00:41:37 -> 00:41:41]  I'm checking my banking right now.
[00:41:42 -> 00:41:43]  Okay, good.
[00:41:43 -> 00:41:45]  Then you'll see that it's there.
[00:41:46 -> 00:41:50]  There is nothing to shout, okay?
[00:41:50 -> 00:41:53]  Okay, don't take it so personally.
[00:41:53 -> 00:41:56]  As I told you, it's a mistake and we are going to put it back.
[00:41:57 -> 00:41:57]  All right.
[00:41:57 -> 00:41:59]  So go ahead right now.
[00:41:59 -> 00:42:03]  Go ahead right now and log into your bank and accept that refund link
[00:42:03 -> 00:42:05]  which we have sent you on your online banking, okay?
[00:42:07 -> 00:42:09]  She came in the middle of the conversation.
[00:42:10 -> 00:42:11]  That's why.
[00:42:11 -> 00:42:12]  That's not an issue.
[00:42:12 -> 00:42:14]  She is upset with you.
[00:42:14 -> 00:42:15]  Okay, not an issue.
[00:42:15 -> 00:42:20]  Go ahead and log in your bank account and verify that link
[00:42:20 -> 00:42:22]  which we have sent you into your online banking.
[00:42:27 -> 00:42:28]  Okay.
[00:42:29 -> 00:42:32]  That last step that you just said, say that again.
[00:42:33 -> 00:42:40]  I just told you, you need to go ahead and you need to log in into your online banking
[00:42:40 -> 00:42:44]  and you need to accept that refund link which we have sent you.
[00:42:46 -> 00:42:46]  Okay.
[00:42:48 -> 00:42:49]  Just go ahead and do it right now.
[00:42:51 -> 00:42:53]  Yeah, she's out in the room doing it.
[00:42:54 -> 00:42:56]  No, no, you need to do it right now from your end.
[00:42:57 -> 00:42:59]  Everything you are doing, so you need to do it right now.
[00:43:02 -> 00:43:03]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:43:09 -> 00:43:12]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:43:12 -> 00:43:17]  Come in here and she's going to tell you to do something.
[00:43:21 -> 00:43:22]  I don't know.
[00:43:22 -> 00:43:26]  I am in the middle and I don't understand what's going on here.
[00:43:26 -> 00:43:28]  What do you mean?
[00:43:34 -> 00:43:37]  This refund form you have to see, ma.
[00:43:58 -> 00:44:01]  Okay, I've got this screen that says what it is.
[00:44:01 -> 00:44:02]  Help you refund form.
[00:44:03 -> 00:44:05]  Money has been sent.
[00:44:06 -> 00:44:07]  You're telling me to go to some place.
[00:44:07 -> 00:44:09]  I don't know where you're telling me to go.
[00:44:10 -> 00:44:13]  On this computer, you need to go ahead and
[00:44:15 -> 00:44:20]  log into your bank and accept the refund link which we have sent you.
[00:44:20 -> 00:44:24]  How do I log into my bank from this computer?
[00:44:25 -> 00:44:26]  Ah, tera ma.
[00:44:28 -> 00:44:29]  Ma's doing it.
[00:44:29 -> 00:44:31]  I mean, she's doing it on the other computer.
[00:44:32 -> 00:44:35]  Your wife is yelling so much.
[00:44:35 -> 00:44:40]  I can't even hear you properly.
[00:44:40 -> 00:44:43]  What, mother?
[00:44:43 -> 00:44:44]  Okay.
[00:44:44 -> 00:44:47]  So what do you see right now?
[00:44:51 -> 00:44:52]  250.
[00:44:55 -> 00:44:57]  She says there's no 250 missing.
[00:44:58 -> 00:45:00]  Okay, just wait for a moment.
[00:45:01 -> 00:45:02]  Wait.
[00:45:02 -> 00:45:10]  Okay, okay, okay.
[00:45:10 -> 00:45:15]  Over there, it won't show you correct that the $250 has been debited.
[00:45:15 -> 00:45:20]  It won't show you correct because right now, we just debited it right now.
[00:45:20 -> 00:45:27]  So it's going to show by late evening or by tomorrow because whenever you go for shopping,
[00:45:27 -> 00:45:30]  if you swipe your card, it won't show you on your online banking.
[00:45:30 -> 00:45:36]  But at the end of the day, at the end of the week, you are going to see that transaction,
[00:45:36 -> 00:45:39]  what is going to be completed once it's going to be posted.
[00:45:39 -> 00:45:42]  So right now, it's not going to show up in your account.
[00:45:42 -> 00:45:44]  But that money has been debited.
[00:45:44 -> 00:45:48]  So that's why I told you to go ahead and log in your bank in this computer.
[00:45:48 -> 00:45:51]  Can you see the long address bar?
[00:45:51 -> 00:45:53]  You need to type down your bank name over there.
[00:45:53 -> 00:45:57]  Go ahead and log in.
[00:46:00 -> 00:46:02]  Can you go ahead and log in?
[00:46:02 -> 00:46:05]  Yeah, this is legit.
[00:46:05 -> 00:46:08]  This is not okay.
[00:46:08 -> 00:46:11]  You want me to type up on there in that address bar?
[00:46:12 -> 00:46:13]  Absolutely.
[00:46:13 -> 00:46:13]  Correct.
[00:46:14 -> 00:46:15]  Absolutely.
[00:46:17 -> 00:46:18]  That's simple to be right.
[00:46:33 -> 00:46:33]  Name of the bank.
[00:46:36 -> 00:46:37]  I need the name of the bank.
[00:46:39 -> 00:46:40]  Okay.
[00:46:42 -> 00:46:49]  I just want to know why did you take that money out?
[00:46:49 -> 00:46:50]  Take that money from my account?
[00:46:50 -> 00:46:53]  It was mistakenly taken out.
[00:46:53 -> 00:46:54]  How could you do that?
[00:46:55 -> 00:46:56]  What was it for?
[00:46:57 -> 00:47:01]  Because as you know, ma'am, that we are fixing the problem.
[00:47:01 -> 00:47:06]  So by mistakenly, they have taken that money just for to fix the problem.
[00:47:06 -> 00:47:07]  It was a mistake.
[00:47:07 -> 00:47:08]  I'm accepting that mistake.
[00:47:14 -> 00:47:17]  They never charged before, ma'am.
[00:47:17 -> 00:47:18]  You said it was a mistake.
[00:47:18 -> 00:47:21]  Because we never gave you any service before.
[00:47:21 -> 00:47:22]  We never give you any support before.
[00:47:22 -> 00:47:24]  That is why they never took any money before.
[00:47:26 -> 00:47:29]  We've been talking to Geek Squad for a long, long time for our problems.
[00:47:30 -> 00:47:35]  I know that you are a membership with us and you are a regular customer.
[00:47:35 -> 00:47:38]  That is the only one reason I am respecting you guys a lot.
[00:47:40 -> 00:47:41]  It's my job.
[00:47:41 -> 00:47:42]  You know what?
[00:47:42 -> 00:47:44]  I think we need to hang up here.
[00:47:44 -> 00:47:44]  No.
[00:47:46 -> 00:47:47]  He's a scammer.
[00:47:47 -> 00:47:49]  It is not a scam.
[00:47:49 -> 00:47:50]  Just pull back out here.
[00:47:50 -> 00:47:51]  It's a scam.
[00:47:51 -> 00:47:51]  It is.
[00:47:55 -> 00:48:03]  I think we need to hang up here and call someone out.
[00:48:06 -> 00:48:06]  Go ahead.
[00:48:08 -> 00:48:09]  Sir.
[00:48:10 -> 00:48:11]  Yes.
[00:48:16 -> 00:48:19]  How old do you want me to go?
[00:48:21 -> 00:48:21]  Okay.
[00:48:21 -> 00:48:27]  Which bank it was?
[00:48:27 -> 00:48:33]  I'm at Simplicity Credit Union.
[00:48:33 -> 00:48:40]  You want me to go to the bank credit card one?
[00:48:47 -> 00:48:51]  Okay.
[00:48:51 -> 00:48:52]  That's website it says.
[00:48:52 -> 00:49:30]  Go ahead.
[00:49:30 -> 00:49:33]  Can I see a little key on my screen?
[00:49:33 -> 00:49:43]  Money of a world.
[00:49:48 -> 00:49:48]  All right.
[00:49:48 -> 00:49:49]  What do you see next over there?
[00:49:53 -> 00:49:54]  I'm at the Simplicity credit union.
[00:49:54 -> 00:50:00]  What do you see sir?
[00:50:00 -> 00:50:01]  Could you please tell me?
[00:50:04 -> 00:50:05]  Simplicity credit union.
[00:50:06 -> 00:50:14]  My email and my password.
[00:50:17 -> 00:50:17]  Okay.
[00:50:17 -> 00:50:20]  Write down your username and write down your password.
[00:50:20 -> 00:50:22]  Whenever you log in your bank,
[00:50:22 -> 00:50:26]  you need to write down the same username and the same password.
[00:50:27 -> 00:50:29]  Don't log in.
[00:50:29 -> 00:50:29]  Don't.
[00:50:29 -> 00:50:30]  Ma, I have to.
[00:50:31 -> 00:50:32]  It's all for that.
[00:50:33 -> 00:50:36]  Oh, don't you understand?
[00:50:36 -> 00:50:48]  No, I should just.
[00:50:49 -> 00:50:51]  I got **redacted** thinking.
[00:50:54 -> 00:50:57]  **redacted**.
[00:51:05 -> 00:51:12]  Go ahead and write down your username and password, sir,
[00:51:12 -> 00:51:14]  so that you can see everything.
[00:51:15 -> 00:51:21]  But my username is not **redacted**.
[00:51:21 -> 00:51:23]  It's **redacted**.
[00:51:23 -> 00:51:50]  No, where's my password?
[00:51:51 -> 00:51:54]  No, give somebody their password.
[00:51:54 -> 00:51:56]  No, give them their password.
[00:52:01 -> 00:52:02]  Get off that phone.
[00:52:03 -> 00:52:04]  Write down the password.
[00:52:06 -> 00:52:07]  Camera.
[00:52:25 -> 00:52:59]  Write down the password.
[00:52:59 -> 00:53:16]  You can change the username.
[00:53:18 -> 00:53:19]  No, it's a wrong username.
[00:53:20 -> 00:53:21]  Absolutely.
[00:53:21 -> 00:53:28]  Make sure the username which you are putting is correct.
[00:53:28 -> 00:53:29]  Right.
[00:53:29 -> 00:53:46]  Okay.
[00:53:48 -> 00:53:53]  Sir, you need to write down your bank username.
[00:53:53 -> 00:53:58]  It should be your bank username.
[00:53:58 -> 00:54:03]  I don't know what my bank username is.
[00:54:05 -> 00:54:05]  You don't know it?
[00:54:05 -> 00:54:11]  Who knows it?
[00:54:11 -> 00:54:12]  Then who knows it?
[00:54:12 -> 00:54:14]  If you don't know it, then who knows it?
[00:54:14 -> 00:54:17]  Oh, you want my bank's name?
[00:54:19 -> 00:54:19]  No, no.
[00:54:19 -> 00:54:21]  Your bank username.
[00:54:21 -> 00:54:23]  Your bank username.
[00:54:30 -> 00:55:01]  Okay, **redacted**.
[00:55:01 -> 00:55:06]  So, I don't know where we are now.
[00:55:06 -> 00:55:09]  You need to write down your bank username.
[00:55:09 -> 00:55:11]  You don't know your bank username, sir?
[00:55:11 -> 00:55:13]  You never do online banking with this computer?
[00:55:16 -> 00:55:18]  No, I never use it on my computer.
[00:55:18 -> 00:55:22]  Then where you use every time?
[00:55:23 -> 00:55:24]  In which device?
[00:55:24 -> 00:55:37]  And this is the only one bank you have?
[00:55:37 -> 00:55:39]  Simplicity Credit Union?
[00:55:40 -> 00:55:43]  Yes, the only bank we own.
[00:55:59 -> 00:56:03]  You need to ask your wife about the bank username.
[00:56:03 -> 00:56:04]  She's not here.
[00:56:06 -> 00:56:06]  She's not here.
[00:56:08 -> 00:56:09]  She left.
[00:56:10 -> 00:56:11]  Where'd she go?
[00:56:11 -> 00:56:14]  Because she figured I was getting scammed.
[00:56:14 -> 00:56:19]  Oh, Jesus Christ, I don't want to scam you.
[00:56:19 -> 00:56:20]  You know it very well.
[00:56:20 -> 00:56:21]  I don't want to scam you.
[00:56:22 -> 00:56:23]  We are not that kind of person.
[00:56:23 -> 00:56:34]  I know you don't understand.
[00:56:34 -> 00:56:36]  If you guys are not going to log in,
[00:56:36 -> 00:56:38]  then how am I going to fix this problem?
[00:56:38 -> 00:56:49]  I don't know what to do.
[00:56:49 -> 00:56:59]  You can help you out.
[00:56:59 -> 00:57:01]  You need to call your wife
[00:57:01 -> 00:57:04]  and ask her about the username and password.
[00:57:10 -> 00:57:11]  She won't do it.
[00:57:11 -> 00:57:14]  She's mad upset.
[00:57:14 -> 00:57:15]  She figured that I...
[00:57:15 -> 00:57:25]  She won't do it?
[00:57:25 -> 00:57:26]  No, she won't do it.
[00:57:26 -> 00:57:35]  Then what should I do right now?
[00:57:39 -> 00:57:41]  Somehow or another, you got to get that...
[00:57:44 -> 00:57:46]  I don't know how you're going to do it, but...
[00:57:47 -> 00:57:51]  I'm going to send you a check.
[00:57:51 -> 00:57:51]  That won't...
[00:57:52 -> 00:57:52]  That won't...
[00:57:53 -> 00:57:55]  I don't think that'll do it.
[00:57:56 -> 00:57:56]  I'm going to send you a...
[00:57:56 -> 00:57:57]  Because it'll come out...
[00:57:59 -> 00:58:02]  Okay, you send a check, but that's not the point.
[00:58:02 -> 00:58:08]  The point is that she's going to do that.
[00:58:08 -> 00:58:10]  I'm going to send you a technician at your home.
[00:58:10 -> 00:58:12]  He's going to fix everything for you, okay?
[00:58:12 -> 00:58:17]  Don't worry about it.
[00:58:17 -> 00:58:18]  When is he going to come?
[00:58:20 -> 00:58:20]  Today itself.
[00:58:22 -> 00:58:23]  Today on.
[00:58:23 -> 00:58:24]  Today over here?
[00:58:24 -> 00:58:28]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:58:28 -> 00:58:29]  Okay.
[00:58:29 -> 00:58:33]  I'll leave my computer on just like it is.
[00:58:34 -> 00:58:34]  Yes, yes.
[00:58:34 -> 00:58:36]  Leave your computer as the way it is.
[00:58:36 -> 00:58:39]  I've had this problem before.
[00:58:40 -> 00:58:41]  No problem.
[00:58:41 -> 00:58:42]  Nothing is going to happen.
[00:58:44 -> 00:58:44]  Thank you so much.
```
