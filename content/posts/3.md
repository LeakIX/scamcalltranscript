```
[00:00:00 -> 00:00:16]  Yeah, hi sir, Patrick Desai, the line got disconnected.
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:27]  Yeah, I know, I'm back to my original screen now.
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:32]  Do you think any of my bank has turned a call for my phone?
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:36]  I don't open strange emails or anything.
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:45]  Sir, I'm not sure until and unless you run the final scan from your end,
[00:00:45 -> 00:00:48]  we can't get to know what is the exact reason.
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:53]  So I just help you in removing the security alert.
[00:00:53 -> 00:00:56]  So you might be in just next half an hour, an hour time,
[00:00:56 -> 00:00:59]  you'll receive that same alert once again.
[00:00:59 -> 00:01:09]  Okay. So if there's something on my computer, it'll come back again.
[00:01:09 -> 00:01:13]  Okay. So I can get it fixed permanently for you.
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:16]  For that, you need to follow some few more steps.
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:21]  So I can guide you and it would be fixed.
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:23]  Okay?
[00:01:23 -> 00:01:26]  Okay. Now, you're going to do that now?
[00:01:26 -> 00:01:32]  Okay. Just look on your screen, left-hand side, bottom corner.
[00:01:32 -> 00:01:37]  Yeah, we're breaking up, the phone's cracking.
[00:01:37 -> 00:01:40]  Okay. Is it better now?
[00:01:40 -> 00:01:43]  Yeah, yeah, that's better.
[00:01:43 -> 00:01:48]  Okay. So look on your screen, left-hand side, bottom corner.
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:57]  Can you see some magnifying glass that says search or type photo search?
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:08]  No, all I see is this PC, driver support.
[00:02:08 -> 00:02:13]  Just very left, can you see the current date and the time on the right-hand side corner?
[00:02:13 -> 00:02:16]  Can you see that?
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:19]  On the right-hand side?
[00:02:19 -> 00:02:23]  Yeah, right-hand side corner, the current date and the time.
[00:02:23 -> 00:02:25]  Yeah, I see that.
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:31]  Okay. If you look on the left-hand side, further to another corner,
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:37]  you will see some very magnifying glass that says search or type photo search.
[00:02:37 -> 00:02:41]  Okay, okay, okay. All right, I got it.
[00:02:41 -> 00:02:42]  Okay.
[00:02:42 -> 00:03:00]  So you need to click and type there as run, R-U-N, run.
[00:03:00 -> 00:03:03]  Okay. Now what do I do?
[00:03:03 -> 00:03:09]  Run's on it, but do I go up and click on top where it says run?
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:14]  Can you see something that says run command on the top?
[00:03:14 -> 00:03:16]  Click on that.
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:20]  Yeah, it says run app.
[00:03:20 -> 00:03:22]  Yeah, open that.
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:25]  Okay, I did.
[00:03:25 -> 00:03:31]  And now in the left-hand corner, type name of program folder document,
[00:03:31 -> 00:03:35]  and it opens MSEC 2.
[00:03:35 -> 00:03:42]  Okay. In front of open, if something is written there, you have to remove that first
[00:03:42 -> 00:03:48]  and type there as WWW.
[00:03:48 -> 00:03:51]  WWW...
[00:03:51 -> 00:03:53]  Three W's?

[00:04:10 -> 00:04:13]  U-L-T-R-A?
[00:04:13 -> 00:04:15]  Yes, that's correct.
[00:04:15 -> 00:04:29]  Then it's Viewer, V-I-E-W-E-R, Viewer.
[00:04:29 -> 00:04:32]  V-I-E-W-E-R?
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:34]  Yes, that's correct.
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:36]  Okay.
[00:04:36 -> 00:04:39]  Dot.

[00:05:09 -> 00:05:12]  So have you clicked on Okay?
[00:05:12 -> 00:05:16]  Yeah, and I have all for Viewer on the screen.
[00:05:16 -> 00:05:20]  Okay, can you see something that's green in color and that says Download?
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:20]  Yeah.
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:21]  Click on that.
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:23]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:23 -> 00:05:26]  Okay.
[00:05:26 -> 00:05:29]  And once you clicked on that.
[00:05:29 -> 00:05:32]  Okay, so it would download on the top right corner
[00:05:32 -> 00:05:34]  and then it will say Open File.
[00:05:34 -> 00:05:37]  Click on Open File.
[00:05:37 -> 00:05:39]  Okay.
[00:05:39 -> 00:05:43]  Okay, do you want to allow this app to make change?
[00:05:43 -> 00:05:51]  Click Yes.
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:54]  Now what you can see?
[00:05:54 -> 00:06:00]  Setup will install Ultra Viewer into the following folder.
[00:06:00 -> 00:06:06]  Okay, so you have to keep clicking on Next until you see the option that says Install.
[00:06:06 -> 00:06:10]  Okay.
[00:06:10 -> 00:06:13]  It says it's already.
[00:06:13 -> 00:06:16]  Would you like to install that to that folder?
[00:06:16 -> 00:06:18]  Yeah, click Install.
[00:06:18 -> 00:06:21]  Click Install.
[00:06:21 -> 00:06:25]  So while it's installing, I just want to confirm with you, sir.
[00:06:25 -> 00:06:30]  Have you shared your Wi-Fi password to anyone recently?
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:32]  Have I did what?
[00:06:32 -> 00:06:38]  Have you shared your Wi-Fi password, your Internet password to anyone?
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:40]  No, no.
[00:06:40 -> 00:06:44]  I don't even know what it is.
[00:06:44 -> 00:06:48]  Okay, and have you traveled anywhere recently?
[00:06:48 -> 00:06:49]  Okay.
[00:06:49 -> 00:06:52]  Not at all.
[00:06:52 -> 00:06:58]  And have you traveled anywhere recently where you might have connected your laptop to any
[00:06:58 -> 00:07:01]  other network other than your home network?
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:02]  No, no.
[00:07:02 -> 00:07:05]  This one stays here all the time.
[00:07:05 -> 00:07:12]  Now, I do, in the Beach House, I have another laptop, but it's, yeah.
[00:07:12 -> 00:07:13]  I'm back now to...
[00:07:13 -> 00:07:16]  Okay.
[00:07:16 -> 00:07:17]  Click on finish.
[00:07:18 -> 00:07:23]  Well, it's on next again, on additional shortcuts.

[00:07:33 -> 00:07:35]  Green bar is coming across.
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:36]  Okay.
[00:07:36 -> 00:07:41]  So the green bar will move from the left-hand side to the right-hand side, and then you
[00:07:41 -> 00:07:43]  will see the option that says finish.
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:47]  While in the meanwhile, it's installing.
[00:07:47 -> 00:07:48]  It's installing.
[00:07:48 -> 00:07:51]  Can you help me out with your first name and the last name, sir?
[00:07:51 -> 00:08:05]  **redacted** **redacted**on, **redacted**, **redacted**-O-N.

[00:08:07 -> 00:08:09]  Yeah, click on finish.
[00:08:09 -> 00:08:15]  So once you click on finish, it will generate a specific ID for your device, which will
[00:08:15 -> 00:08:19]  help us in connecting to the Microsoft Secure Server.
[00:08:19 -> 00:08:23]  So can you help me out with the ID that says your ID?
[00:08:23 -> 00:08:37]  Yeah, your ID, **redacted**, and space **redacted**, space **redacted**.
[00:08:37 -> 00:08:41]  Okay, and can you help me out with the password also?

[00:08:47 -> 00:08:52]  Okay, let me just try to connect it to the Microsoft Secure Server.
[00:08:52 -> 00:09:01]  So the ID is **redacted**, is that correct?
[00:09:01 -> 00:09:02]  Yes.
[00:09:02 -> 00:09:14]  Okay.
[00:09:14 -> 00:09:20]  Okay, so now what you need to do, just look for the magnifying glass earlier which you found.
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:26]  Just type there as run once again, R-U-N, run.
[00:09:26 -> 00:09:30]  Well, it's gone now.
[00:09:30 -> 00:09:38]  Just type it once again, sir, R-U-N with the magnifying glass on the bottom code.
[00:09:38 -> 00:09:52]  And once the small box opens, just do let me know.
[00:09:52 -> 00:10:00]  Okay, I'll have the box open on the left now. Type name of program and folder.

[00:10:10 -> 00:10:13]  C-M, okay.
[00:10:13 -> 00:10:15]  Then it's D like Delta.
[00:10:15 -> 00:10:18]  Okay.
[00:10:18 -> 00:10:20]  Now click okay.
[00:10:20 -> 00:10:46]  Now what you can see on your screen, sir?
[00:10:46 -> 00:10:58]  Well, the first box is rocket malware detected on the Windows firewall alert.
[00:10:58 -> 00:11:03]  And it's scanning commonly infected areas.
[00:11:03 -> 00:11:05]  Okay, not a problem.
[00:11:05 -> 00:11:15]  Okay, can you click on the magnifying glass that you search once again and type there as run once again?
[00:11:15 -> 00:11:36]  Just come up to...
[00:11:36 -> 00:11:39]  What you can see now?
[00:11:39 -> 00:11:44]  Well, I can see edge, word, Excel, mail, calendar.
[00:11:44 -> 00:11:50]  Okay, can you see some magnifying glass there that you search for apps, something like that?
[00:11:50 -> 00:12:00]  Yeah, when I go up on the run, do I click here?
[00:12:00 -> 00:12:04]  Yes, yes.
[00:12:04 -> 00:12:09]  Okay, it leaves when I click it.
[00:12:09 -> 00:12:21]  Okay, if something is there written on the small box, remove that and type there as CMD Charlie Mike Delta.
[00:12:21 -> 00:12:25]  On the bottom left?
[00:12:25 -> 00:12:31]  Yes, that's correct.
[00:12:31 -> 00:12:35]  Okay, I'm sorry, what was it, Charlie?
[00:12:35 -> 00:12:40]  Charlie Mike Delta.
[00:12:40 -> 00:12:41]  Okay.
[00:12:41 -> 00:12:42]  Now click okay.
[00:12:42 -> 00:12:53]  All right, okay, now I have a black screen.
[00:12:53 -> 00:13:03]  Okay, so what we need to do, first we need to check the fetus for your network.
[00:13:03 -> 00:13:09]  Okay, so type there where the blinker is blinking, type NET, net.
[00:13:09 -> 00:13:17]  NET?
[00:13:17 -> 00:13:18]  Yes, that's correct.
[00:13:18 -> 00:13:24]  Okay.
[00:13:24 -> 00:13:26]  Then it's S like sugar.
[00:13:26 -> 00:13:34]  Let me move a little, you're breaking up again.
[00:13:34 -> 00:13:36]  It's S like sugar.
[00:13:36 -> 00:13:40]  Okay, I have NET.
[00:13:40 -> 00:13:44]  Yes, after that it's S like sugar.
[00:13:44 -> 00:13:45]  S like sugar.
[00:13:45 -> 00:13:46]  Okay.
[00:13:46 -> 00:13:48]  Okay.
[00:13:48 -> 00:13:49]  T like tango.
[00:13:49 -> 00:13:57]  What was the next one?
[00:13:57 -> 00:13:59]  I have NETS.
[00:13:59 -> 00:14:02]  Then it's T, T like Tom.
[00:14:02 -> 00:14:04]  Or tango.
[00:14:04 -> 00:14:05]  Okay, T.
[00:14:05 -> 00:14:09]  Okay, NET and T.
[00:14:09 -> 00:14:11]  Then it's A like apple.
[00:14:11 -> 00:14:15]  A, okay.
[00:14:15 -> 00:14:18]  Then it's T like tango once again.
[00:14:18 -> 00:14:25]  E.
[00:14:25 -> 00:14:31]  It's P, T like Tom or tomato or tango.
[00:14:31 -> 00:14:33]  Oh, again?
[00:14:33 -> 00:14:35]  Yes.
[00:14:35 -> 00:14:41]  Okay, what I have now is NETSTAT.
[00:14:41 -> 00:14:45]  Okay, so that's the short form for network status.
[00:14:45 -> 00:14:58]  Now what you need to do, hit enter.
[00:14:58 -> 00:15:09]  Okay.
[00:15:09 -> 00:15:11]  So a scan must be going on.
[00:15:11 -> 00:15:19]  So once the scan is over, you'll go to the same page that says C colon backward slash user, something like that.
[00:15:19 -> 00:15:22]  So once you reach on that point, just do let me know.
[00:15:22 -> 00:15:28]  Okay, it's just filling in.
[00:15:28 -> 00:15:31]  Okay, now say user again.
[00:15:31 -> 00:15:32]  Okay.
[00:15:32 -> 00:15:37]  Let me just get a copy of that, just be on the line.
[00:15:37 -> 00:15:39]  Okay, Mr. **redacted**, I'll just go there.
[00:15:39 -> 00:15:45]  So can you see some numbers under the local address that's starting with 192.168?
[00:15:45 -> 00:15:47]  Can you see those numbers?
[00:15:47 -> 00:15:48]  All are the same?
[00:15:48 -> 00:15:49]  Oh yeah.
[00:15:49 -> 00:15:50]  Starting with the same numbers?
[00:15:50 -> 00:15:51]  Yeah.
[00:15:51 -> 00:15:52]  Okay.
[00:15:52 -> 00:15:54]  So this is your IP address of your laptop.
[00:15:54 -> 00:15:59]  Do you know what is the IP address?
[00:15:59 -> 00:16:00]  No.
[00:16:00 -> 00:16:01]  Okay.
[00:16:01 -> 00:16:08]  So it is an address similar to what we have, our home address for laptop and devices.
[00:16:08 -> 00:16:13]  It's called as Internet Protocol Address or you can say IP address.
[00:16:13 -> 00:16:17]  So as it's one device, so it keeps remaining the same.
[00:16:17 -> 00:16:24]  But the thing that we need to be worrying about here or we need to be concerned is the foreign addresses.
[00:16:24 -> 00:16:28]  It shows different, different foreign addresses.
[00:16:28 -> 00:16:39]  It's starting with like 2.0, then it's second one is EC2, then it's 2.0, then EC2, and a couple of different foreign addresses.
[00:16:39 -> 00:16:46]  It means your device is getting access from different, different locations.
[00:16:46 -> 00:16:54]  So like someone is accessing it, it is established, it means they are able to make a secured connection.
[00:16:54 -> 00:17:08]  Okay, can you just type where the blinker is blinking, type there as once again the same thing, that is NETSTAT.
[00:17:08 -> 00:17:11]  Okay, NET.
[00:17:11 -> 00:17:24]  Yes, then it's STAT.
[00:17:24 -> 00:17:28]  NETST, what was next?
[00:17:28 -> 00:17:32]  Yes, then it's A like apple, T like tango.
[00:17:32 -> 00:17:34]  A.
[00:17:34 -> 00:17:37]  NETSTA, okay.
[00:17:37 -> 00:17:41]  Then it's P, T like tango, or Tom.
[00:17:41 -> 00:17:47]  P, okay.
[00:17:47 -> 00:17:49]  Then give space.
[00:17:49 -> 00:17:50]  Okay.
[00:17:50 -> 00:17:52]  You have to give one space.
[00:17:52 -> 00:17:53]  Space?
[00:17:53 -> 00:17:54]  Yes.
[00:17:54 -> 00:17:55]  Okay.
[00:17:55 -> 00:17:57]  Then a minus sign.
[00:17:57 -> 00:18:05]  Minus sign.
[00:18:05 -> 00:18:11]  Is that where there's two bars, the lower one?
[00:18:11 -> 00:18:12]  Yes.
[00:18:12 -> 00:18:13]  Yes.
[00:18:13 -> 00:18:14]  Okay.
[00:18:14 -> 00:18:15]  Okay.
[00:18:15 -> 00:18:18]  Then it's E like apple.
[00:18:18 -> 00:18:21]  Apple.
[00:18:21 -> 00:18:22]  Okay.
[00:18:22 -> 00:18:31]  Now hit enter.
[00:18:31 -> 00:18:35]  Okay.
[00:18:35 -> 00:18:37]  Once the scan is over, just do let me know.
[00:18:37 -> 00:18:44]  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff up there.
[00:18:44 -> 00:18:47]  Okay.
[00:18:47 -> 00:18:48]  Let me just get a copy of that.
[00:18:48 -> 00:18:51]  Okay, Mr. **redacted**.
[00:18:51 -> 00:18:54]  It says, state as listening.
[00:18:54 -> 00:18:55]  Can you see that?

[00:34:01 -> 00:34:04]  So once it stops, just do let me know.
[00:34:04 -> 00:34:05]  Okay.
[00:34:05 -> 00:34:14]  So who else uses this laptop other than you and your family, Mr. Mitchell?
[00:34:14 -> 00:34:24]  No one.
[00:34:24 -> 00:34:45]  The only place it's ever been is over to Staples and they were supposed to put from wax and
[00:34:45 -> 00:34:54]  now I don't know what kind of, you know, something to prevent this.
[00:34:54 -> 00:34:55]  Okay.
[00:34:55 -> 00:34:56]  Okay.
[00:34:56 -> 00:34:57]  It's down here now.
[00:34:57 -> 00:34:58]  The last thing I see is banking error.
[00:34:58 -> 00:34:59]  Okay.
[00:34:59 -> 00:35:00]  It means the scan is over.
[00:35:00 -> 00:35:01]  Let me just get a copy of that.
[00:35:01 -> 00:35:02]  Just one.
[00:35:02 -> 00:35:03]  Okay.
[00:35:03 -> 00:35:04]  Okay.
[00:35:04 -> 00:35:05]  Okay.
[00:35:05 -> 00:35:06]  Okay.
[00:35:06 -> 00:35:07]  Okay.
[00:35:07 -> 00:35:13]  Okay.
[00:35:13 -> 00:35:37]  So Mr. **redacted**, it says device at risk, and then it says phone line tagged, okay, so which
[00:35:37 -> 00:35:42]  we have already run the scan that is listening, so this is the reason it says phone line tagged.
[00:35:42 -> 00:35:46]  And it says child pornography downloaded.
[00:35:46 -> 00:35:52]  Have you used this laptop to do any kind of pornography stuff on this device, Mr. **redacted**?
[00:35:52 -> 00:35:56]  Oh no, no, absolutely not.
[00:35:56 -> 00:36:03]  Okay, because this seems like the major issue here, child pornography downloaded, as that's
[00:36:03 -> 00:36:04]  an illegal thing.
[00:36:05 -> 00:36:11]  There's a reason it shows here, it shows child pornography downloaded.
[00:36:11 -> 00:36:17]  So this is illegal stuff, not legal at any part of the world.
[00:36:17 -> 00:36:23]  So Windows thinks like this device has been used to do some child pornography downloading.
[00:36:23 -> 00:36:26]  And we have blocked your access.
[00:36:26 -> 00:36:30]  So I get to the point now.
[00:36:30 -> 00:36:36]  The person might be like who got access, he's using your device and your details to download
[00:36:36 -> 00:36:37]  these things.
[00:36:37 -> 00:36:42]  They can't use their own devices, they just got access of your device and they are using
[00:36:42 -> 00:36:45]  it to download some child pornography.
[00:36:45 -> 00:36:48]  And I'll just tell you how these things work.
[00:36:48 -> 00:36:54]  So they have to register themselves on the porn website or any other website which has
[00:36:54 -> 00:37:00]  the child pornography and they might be using your name and your details for downloading
[00:37:00 -> 00:37:03]  those things.
[00:37:03 -> 00:37:06]  And then it says card used starting with four.
[00:37:06 -> 00:37:12]  Do you have any like debit card that start with number four, Mr. **redacted**?
[00:37:12 -> 00:37:13]  That what now?
[00:37:13 -> 00:37:14]  That what?
[00:37:14 -> 00:37:21]  Do you have any debit card that start with number four?
[00:37:21 -> 00:37:22]  Debit card?
[00:37:22 -> 00:37:26]  I don't know, I don't use debit card.
[00:37:27 -> 00:37:33]  Okay, because don't use card used starting with four, there might be a debit card or
[00:37:33 -> 00:37:38]  a credit card that has been used on these websites.
[00:37:38 -> 00:37:41]  It says banking error.
[00:37:41 -> 00:37:42]  Yeah.
[00:37:42 -> 00:37:57]  No, my credit cards, my wife and I, it starts with three.
[00:37:57 -> 00:38:02]  If I heard you correctly, Mr. **redacted**, you got this error while you were just trying
[00:38:02 -> 00:38:03]  to log into your bank account.
[00:38:03 -> 00:38:04]  Is that correct?
[00:38:04 -> 00:38:08]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:38:08 -> 00:38:13]  When I was logged into my bank account and when I got out of it, that's when this error
[00:38:13 -> 00:38:14]  came up.
[00:38:14 -> 00:38:20]  Okay, because that seems like it's been compromised now.
[00:38:20 -> 00:38:26]  Can you just try to log in once again and just see if you're able to log in and everything
[00:38:26 -> 00:38:27]  seems fine?
[00:38:27 -> 00:38:33]  Because it seems there's an issue with the bank and you can try to do that, sir.
[00:38:33 -> 00:38:47]  Because right now it's connected to the Microsoft Decode server, just try to log in if you're
[00:38:47 -> 00:38:53]  able to log in and just check under the pending transactions and all if everything is fine
[00:38:53 -> 00:39:06]  or not.
[00:39:06 -> 00:39:18]  Well, my password and everything stays in and no, I'm not able to, yeah, it's just
[00:39:18 -> 00:39:24]  going slow.
[00:39:24 -> 00:39:32]  Yeah, I have three accounts at this bank and I can see all of them.
[00:39:32 -> 00:39:38]  Okay, just check all three of them and under the pending transaction, if you know how
[00:39:38 -> 00:39:47]  to get the check, just go ahead and just check that.
[00:39:47 -> 00:39:51]  See if there's any checks.
[00:39:51 -> 00:39:52]  Maybe any pending transaction.
[00:39:52 -> 00:40:00]  No, I don't see anything out of order.
[00:40:00 -> 00:40:04]  Okay, and do you have this only one financial institution?
[00:40:04 -> 00:40:09]  If you have any another, just go ahead and just check with that with two.
[00:40:09 -> 00:40:14]  Okay, okay, let me check American Express.
[00:40:14 -> 00:40:15]  That was one bank.
[00:40:24 -> 00:40:26]  I wonder how someone got my information.
[00:40:26 -> 00:40:34]  Sir, it seems like someone got access.
[00:40:34 -> 00:40:39]  So I'm just removing those accesses for you and I'll upgrade your Windows Defender.
[00:40:39 -> 00:40:43]  But till the time I just want to make sure everything seems fine.
[00:40:43 -> 00:40:48]  Because in the scan, some illegal stuff comes up, so we have to file you in a case report
[00:40:48 -> 00:40:49]  against that.
[00:40:49 -> 00:40:55]  So just to make sure, like everything is in order, okay?
[00:40:55 -> 00:40:57]  So can you just do one more thing?
[00:40:57 -> 00:41:01]  Can you see the search option there in the bottom that says magnifying glass?
[00:41:01 -> 00:41:08]  Okay, what do I need to do now?
[00:41:08 -> 00:41:14]  Just type there as MRT, Mike Romeo Tangle.
[00:41:14 -> 00:41:15]  Under search?
[00:41:15 -> 00:41:16]  Yes.
[00:41:16 -> 00:41:24]  Okay, please tell me one more time.
[00:41:24 -> 00:41:26]  It's M, M like Mike.
[00:41:26 -> 00:41:35]  Okay, M, okay, next.
[00:41:35 -> 00:41:37]  Then it's R like Romeo.
[00:41:38 -> 00:41:40]  Okay, MR.
[00:41:40 -> 00:41:42]  Then it's T like Tom.
[00:41:42 -> 00:41:44]  Okay.
[00:41:44 -> 00:41:48]  T, okay, MRT, okay.
[00:41:48 -> 00:41:50]  Yeah, click on that MRT run command.
[00:41:50 -> 00:42:06]  And once you click on the MRT run command, you will see your option.
[00:42:06 -> 00:42:08]  What I do is I click search.
[00:42:08 -> 00:42:12]  Do I click search?
[00:42:12 -> 00:42:16]  Can you see somewhere that says MRT run command?
[00:42:16 -> 00:42:28]  Yeah, I see MRT antivirus windows and MRT, okay, MRT web search results.
[00:42:28 -> 00:42:38]  Okay, under the best match, can you see somewhere MRT run command on the very top?
[00:42:38 -> 00:42:40]  Okay, click on that.
[00:42:40 -> 00:42:42]  Well, it all went away.
[00:42:42 -> 00:42:48]  Now what did I do?
[00:42:48 -> 00:42:50]  It went away.
[00:42:50 -> 00:42:54]  Okay, maybe type it once again, MRT.
[00:42:54 -> 00:42:57]  Okay, just type it there, MRT once again.
[00:42:57 -> 00:43:14]  Okay, run command now?
[00:43:14 -> 00:43:15]  Yes.
[00:43:15 -> 00:43:25]  Okay, yes or no do you want to allow?
[00:43:25 -> 00:43:29]  Click yes.
[00:43:29 -> 00:43:31]  Yes, okay.
[00:43:31 -> 00:43:39]  Okay, I have windows in the top left.
[00:43:39 -> 00:43:44]  Okay, can you read out to me what it says?
[00:43:44 -> 00:43:51]  Click next to scan for and help remove specific malicious software.
[00:43:51 -> 00:43:54]  Okay, click next only one time.
[00:43:54 -> 00:43:58]  Press next.
[00:43:58 -> 00:43:59]  Yes.
[00:43:59 -> 00:44:02]  Okay.
[00:44:02 -> 00:44:08]  Then you will see three options, click scan, full scan, customize scan.
[00:44:08 -> 00:44:11]  So you have to select full scan.
[00:44:11 -> 00:44:19]  Full scan, quick scan, full scan, okay.
[00:44:19 -> 00:44:20]  Okay.
[00:44:20 -> 00:44:22]  And now click next.
[00:44:22 -> 00:44:23]  Yes, click next.
[00:44:23 -> 00:44:25]  Okay.
[00:44:25 -> 00:44:26]  Okay.
[00:44:26 -> 00:44:30]  So this will search throughout your device.
[00:44:30 -> 00:44:36]  For any malicious software, if something has been implemented or implanted by the hackers,
[00:44:36 -> 00:44:39]  it will find that and it will remove that.
[00:44:39 -> 00:44:44]  In the meanwhile, what I'll do, I'll just keep a close look on your details
[00:44:44 -> 00:44:48]  and I'll just keep removing if any unauthorized access comes up.
[00:44:48 -> 00:44:52]  And I'll upgrade your Windows Defender Security.
[00:44:52 -> 00:44:59]  But that might take approximately like 12 to 18 hours from now.
[00:44:59 -> 00:45:01]  So we have to fix that.
[00:45:01 -> 00:45:03]  So that's going to be a long procedure.
[00:45:03 -> 00:45:07]  So maybe I'll just connect you tomorrow with the updated status.
[00:45:07 -> 00:45:14]  In the meanwhile, we will analyze your scan results reports also from our fraud analyzer team.
[00:45:14 -> 00:45:18]  So they'll just analyze that, and I'll give you more details on that plan.
[00:45:18 -> 00:45:28]  Is it okay if I can give you a call by tomorrow, by let's say by somewhere between 10 to 11, if that's fine for you?
[00:45:28 -> 00:45:31]  Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[00:45:31 -> 00:45:36]  Well, I need to be at the computer.
[00:45:36 -> 00:45:44]  I'll be away at work, but it takes me 30 minutes to get back home.
[00:45:44 -> 00:45:49]  Okay, not a problem. You don't have to be in front of the computer at that time.
[00:45:49 -> 00:45:54]  Maybe at what time you start for work, basically.
[00:45:54 -> 00:46:00]  Yeah, that's fine. Anytime you call, be fine.
[00:46:00 -> 00:46:09]  Okay, and the number from which you're calling right now, that's **redacted**. That's your mobile number. Is that correct?
[00:46:09 -> 00:46:12]  Correct.
[00:46:12 -> 00:46:18]  Okay, not a problem. I'll give you a call by tomorrow between 10 to 11, somewhere.
[00:46:18 -> 00:46:19]  Okay.
[00:46:19 -> 00:46:22]  Then maybe you can speak and I'll let you know the details further.
[00:46:22 -> 00:46:29]  In the meanwhile, now the scan is going on, so leave your computer as it is. So it might take approximately an hour's time.
[00:46:29 -> 00:46:38]  So if something comes suspicious, it will find and remove that. I'll upgrade the Windows Defender from the backend. I'll just put it first accordingly.
[00:46:38 -> 00:46:39]  Okay.
[00:46:39 -> 00:46:40]  Okay.
[00:46:40 -> 00:46:45]  Okay, do I need to contact my bank or you think I'm okay?
[00:46:45 -> 00:46:52]  I won't suggest you to contact anyone as of now, Mr. **redacted**, because your phone's lines are still shows hacked.
[00:46:52 -> 00:47:00]  Until and unless we don't secure your network, if you do call directly to your bank, the hackers will get information.
[00:47:00 -> 00:47:08]  And tomorrow till the time I'll call you and finishing this, fixing this issue, they might be able to get a hold of it.
[00:47:08 -> 00:47:09]  Okay.
[00:47:09 -> 00:47:14]  They can even do. So don't do anything. Don't call to anyone, if possible.
[00:47:14 -> 00:47:18]  And don't explain or discuss anything over the call.
[00:47:18 -> 00:47:25]  Because we are calling from a secure line, but the normal phone calls that we make, those are like normal phone calls.
[00:47:25 -> 00:47:26]  Okay?
[00:47:26 -> 00:47:33]  Yeah. So over the internet, I'd like to come in on my phone and my wife's phone, correct?
[00:47:33 -> 00:47:36]  It can be in both of them, sir. We are not sure.
[00:47:36 -> 00:47:39]  Because we have to analyze the whole scan report.
[00:47:39 -> 00:47:47]  Then we can advise you which old devices are they with in concern and which all the hackers just got access and all.
[00:47:47 -> 00:47:50]  So I'll let you know tomorrow in details.
[00:47:50 -> 00:47:56]  If anything's suspicious or suspicious, I'll just keep contacting you on that phone, okay?
[00:47:56 -> 00:47:58]  So let the scan results go around.
[00:47:58 -> 00:48:01]  Okay.
[00:48:01 -> 00:48:02]  Yeah, it's still going.
[00:48:02 -> 00:48:04]  I'll call you tomorrow.
[00:48:04 -> 00:48:07]  It just got started on the green.
[00:48:08 -> 00:48:10]  Okay, I'll answer tomorrow.
[00:48:11 -> 00:48:12]  Okay.
[00:48:12 -> 00:48:13]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:48:13 -> 00:48:14]  Thank you so much.
[00:48:14 -> 00:48:15]  You're welcome.
[00:48:15 -> 00:48:16]  Thank you.
[00:48:17 -> 00:48:18]  Have a nice evening.
[00:48:18 -> 00:48:19]  Thank you.
[00:48:19 -> 00:48:20]  You too.
```
