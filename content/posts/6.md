[00:59:16 -> 00:59:18]  actually
[00:59:18 -> 00:59:22]  being utilized by some devious person and
[00:59:23 -> 00:59:28]  Why would you need now to know about any other cards that I've got?
[00:59:28 -> 00:59:33]  I don't I as I've told you I don't need any details from you
[00:59:33 -> 00:59:41]  What I'm trying to tell you we are putting ma'am, how many notifications you have received just try to understand like ma'am without your knowledge
[00:59:42 -> 00:59:46]  Somebody's charging like around 10 to 15 times or 7 to 8 times
[00:59:46 -> 00:59:49]  They have charged the card and you have got all the messages from the bank
[00:59:49 -> 00:59:53]  If you can see all the messages coming from the bank on your number ma'am
[00:59:53 -> 00:59:58]  That means there is some potential threat on the account and I don't need your
[00:59:58 -> 01:00:00]  card
... Line cut ...
[00:00:00 -> 00:00:10]  Sorry ma'am the line got disconnected.
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:11]  Yeah.
[00:00:11 -> 00:00:12]  All right.
[00:00:12 -> 00:00:13]  Okay.
[00:00:13 -> 00:00:16]  No ma'am I don't, yeah I don't seek any details ma'am I've been telling you from the start
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:17]  of the call.
[00:00:17 -> 00:00:20]  You have got the reference number, you have got everything ma'am.
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:24]  If you want to validate you can go to the bank tomorrow, get verified all the stuff
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:25]  ma'am.
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:31]  I'm giving you my job ID and my name ma'am, just note it down.
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:36]  My name is Edward Wilson.
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:40]  Just make a note so that you can have all the details tomorrow when you will be going
[00:00:40 -> 00:00:41]  to the bank ma'am.
[00:00:41 -> 00:00:42]  Right.
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:43]  Okay.
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:48]  Now just note down my job ID ma'am.
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:53]  Like my banking job ID is COMSCOMSECURITY146786.
[00:00:53 -> 00:00:56]  Yes ma'am.
[00:00:56 -> 00:01:02]  Yes ma'am.
[00:01:02 -> 00:01:04]  Just keep it with you.
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:07]  Get verified tomorrow morning when you will be going to the bank.
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:10]  Just provide me the reference number for this call ma'am.
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:13]  When they will put it on the system they can confirm to you.
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:15]  You don't have to ask anything.
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:16]  They can confirm you all the stuff.
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:19]  Now ma'am I'm going to just put a scan on the second card.
[00:01:19 -> 00:01:21]  Please verify only the card ma'am.
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:22]  Just confirm.
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:26]  I think I'll do that at the bank tomorrow.
[00:01:27 -> 00:01:31]  This transaction request has already been placed ma'am.
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:34]  I'm not asking to share the name on the card or any details.
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:39]  Just validate the registration only ma'am so that we can ensure the card is with you.
[00:01:39 -> 00:01:42]  Only confirm the first phone number ma'am.
[00:01:42 -> 00:01:48]  First phone number ma'am.
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:50]  Just look for...
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:52]  **redacted** I have confirmed to you ma'am.
[00:01:52 -> 00:01:55]  It's a **redacted** at the start of the call I have confirmed to you.
[00:01:55 -> 00:01:57]  It's **redacted**.
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:00]  You are saying no I don't have any card with such numbers.
[00:02:00 -> 00:02:05]  I have told you at the start of the call you got a card which starts with 5326.
[00:02:05 -> 00:02:06]  It's a master debit card.
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:08]  Am I correct?
[00:02:08 -> 00:02:10]  Yes.
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:11]  Now you understand.
[00:02:11 -> 00:02:12]  We have all the numbers ma'am.
[00:02:12 -> 00:02:17]  I don't care because when we put your account on the scan we got these two numbers ma'am.
[00:02:17 -> 00:02:20]  5353 and 5326.
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:23]  And you haven't got 5217.
[00:02:23 -> 00:02:26]  You also got a master debit card with a smart access account.
[00:02:26 -> 00:02:31]  And you also got 5326 which is linked with your smart access account ma'am.
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:34]  Now please verify only the last eight numbers ma'am.
[00:02:34 -> 00:02:37]  Just confirm.
[00:02:37 -> 00:02:40]  Why am I doing this one?
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:42]  Ma'am this one we will put on a scan.
[00:02:42 -> 00:02:43]  I don't need the full number.
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:46]  Only verify the last eight.
[00:02:46 -> 00:02:47]  Just confirm.
[00:02:47 -> 00:02:50]  **redacted**.
[00:02:50 -> 00:02:53]  **redacted**.
[00:02:53 -> 00:02:56]  **redacted**.
[00:02:56 -> 00:02:57]  **redacted**.
[00:02:57 -> 00:02:58]  Okay.
[00:02:58 -> 00:03:03]  Now ma'am you want to understand why let me send you the message first so that you can
[00:03:03 -> 00:03:05]  have a clear understanding what is happening.
[00:03:05 -> 00:03:07]  I will be sending you a notification ma'am.
[00:03:07 -> 00:03:09]  Just check what is happening.
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:13]  They are using the master credit and the debit card ma'am all the time.
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:17]  I don't know who is this person like Mr. Mark Hobbs.
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:22]  You know anybody in your family friend or any common person whose name is Mr. Mark Hobbs?
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:24]  No.
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:25]  Okay.
[00:03:25 -> 00:03:31]  So ma'am I will be just verifying you the stuff and you will be getting the message.
[00:03:31 -> 00:03:39]  Just hold on ma'am so that you can understand what they are trying to do.
[00:03:39 -> 00:03:44]  They are trying to use both the transactions on the cards ma'am and they have tried to
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:45]  purchase the cards.
[00:03:45 -> 00:03:50]  If you can check with your messages ma'am it's a VND.
[00:03:50 -> 00:03:55]  This time they have used a payment of $199 ma'am.
[00:03:55 -> 00:03:56]  Just check.
[00:03:56 -> 00:03:57]  Any message for $199?
[00:03:57 -> 00:04:02]  Just check ma'am.
[00:04:02 -> 00:04:07]  You got any message with this card which ends in **redacted** ma'am.
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:10]  I didn't actually use that card at all.
[00:04:10 -> 00:04:17]  That's because when we put it on the scan ma'am we see this card has not been used
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:20]  for any transaction in the recent times.
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:22]  You never use this card am I correct?
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:24]  That's right.
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:26]  Okay just hold on ma'am.
[00:04:26 -> 00:04:30]  What is happening they even don't know that this card is not active.
[00:04:30 -> 00:04:32]  You are not using it on the internet.
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:35]  You are not using it for any online activity.
[00:04:35 -> 00:04:41]  But still ma'am we can see they are trying to charge the card for $199.
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:45]  And this transaction request we got from the system.
[00:04:45 -> 00:04:47]  Did you activate this card ma'am?
[00:04:47 -> 00:04:49]  5326 card ma'am?
[00:04:49 -> 00:04:51]  Yes.
[00:04:51 -> 00:04:54]  That's one that finishes this month.
[00:04:54 -> 00:04:55]  Okay.
[00:04:55 -> 00:04:58]  I'll be verifying you the last eight number ma'am.
[00:04:58 -> 00:05:00]  Just get handy with the card.
[00:05:00 -> 00:05:02]  5326 card ma'am.
[00:05:02 -> 00:05:04]  I'll be verifying you the last eight.
[00:05:04 -> 00:05:07]  It's **redacted**.
[00:05:07 -> 00:05:09]  I'll be reading you back ma'am.
[00:05:09 -> 00:05:17]  It's **redacted**.
[00:05:17 -> 00:05:19]  Correct.
[00:05:19 -> 00:05:20]  Okay.
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:23]  Now let me put a block onto this transaction ma'am.
[00:05:23 -> 00:05:27]  And this card which you are using ma'am, 5326 card.
[00:05:27 -> 00:05:31]  You have got all the same numbers as they belong to the same account.
[00:05:31 -> 00:05:33]  You've got the same expiry date.
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:35]  Just check on the card ma'am.
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:41]  Like what the expiry is reflecting on the **redacted** card ma'am.
[00:05:41 -> 00:05:43]  **redacted**.
[00:05:43 -> 00:05:48]  It's like it is about to get expired ma'am.
[00:05:48 -> 00:05:52]  **redacted**.
[00:05:52 -> 00:05:53]  Yes.
[00:05:53 -> 00:05:54]  Okay.
[00:05:54 -> 00:05:55]  Just hold on.
[00:05:55 -> 00:05:57]  And did you apply for a new card ma'am?
[00:05:57 -> 00:05:58]  Yes.
[00:05:58 -> 00:06:04]  Just hold on ma'am.
[00:06:04 -> 00:06:10]  And just check is it **redacted** or you've got any other three numbers at the back of the card ma'am.
[00:06:10 -> 00:06:12]  Just have a look.
[00:06:12 -> 00:06:14]  It's got a different number.
[00:06:14 -> 00:06:15]  Just confirm it ma'am.
[00:06:15 -> 00:06:16]  Let me verify.
[00:06:16 -> 00:06:20]  It's **redacted**.
[00:06:20 -> 00:06:22]  **redacted**.
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:28]  Just read me back ma'am once again.
[00:06:28 -> 00:06:32]  What am I reading back?
[00:06:33 -> 00:06:38]  At the back of the card is it **redacted** or you've got a different number.
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:41]  Just confirm the number on the back of the card ma'am.
[00:06:41 -> 00:06:42]  I have a different number.
[00:06:42 -> 00:06:43]  Just confirm it ma'am.
[00:06:43 -> 00:06:47]  I know ma'am because they are using **redacted**.
[00:06:47 -> 00:06:51]  What they are trying to do, they are trying to mix up the steps.
[00:06:51 -> 00:06:54]  It is **redacted**.
[00:06:54 -> 00:06:56]  It's **redacted**.
[00:06:56 -> 00:06:57]  Correct.
[00:06:57 -> 00:07:01]  Okay ma'am.
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:05]  I'm just putting the card on the stand.
[00:07:05 -> 00:07:07]  Just hold it.
[00:07:07 -> 00:07:12]  And ma'am once this transaction is blocked, we will just send you the notification.
[00:07:12 -> 00:07:18]  Give me a few seconds.
[00:07:18 -> 00:07:31]  And ma'am this card and **redacted**, you use the same PIN for both the cards ma'am?
[00:07:31 -> 00:07:34]  Essentially.
[00:07:34 -> 00:07:35]  That's the reason.
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:37]  Ma'am it's always suggested from the system ma'am.
[00:07:37 -> 00:07:42]  Don't use same PIN for both the cards because if one card gets compromised,
[00:07:42 -> 00:07:47]  the second card also has a very potential threat ma'am that it could also get compromised.
[00:07:47 -> 00:07:48]  That's the reason ma'am.
[00:07:48 -> 00:07:51]  Ma'am I need to put a block onto the PIN ma'am.
[00:07:51 -> 00:07:54]  Do you recall the PIN for the card ma'am so that we can block it ma'am?
[00:07:54 -> 00:07:55]  Just verify.
[00:07:55 -> 00:08:00]  I will not be providing my PIN number.
[00:08:00 -> 00:08:02]  Ma'am you don't have to provide me.
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:03]  I'm doing it for you.
[00:08:03 -> 00:08:05]  I'm blocking it ma'am.
[00:08:05 -> 00:08:09]  So that you can get a confirmation message on your number ma'am.
[00:08:09 -> 00:08:13]  Every time I'm doing any stuff ma'am I'm sending you a copy.
[00:08:13 -> 00:08:18]  So that when you will be going to the bank tomorrow you can get verified your messages.
[00:08:18 -> 00:08:19]  Just show the messages.
[00:08:19 -> 00:08:24]  Even they will confirm that yes they have cancelled all the transactions and along with the PIN ma'am.
[00:08:24 -> 00:08:25]  Please verify.
[00:08:25 -> 00:08:26]  It's a four digit PIN ma'am.
[00:08:26 -> 00:08:29]  Like if you keep in your date of birth or anything like that.
[00:08:29 -> 00:08:30]  Just verify.
[00:08:30 -> 00:08:35]  What am I verifying?
[00:08:35 -> 00:08:36]  Yes I have a PIN number.
[00:08:36 -> 00:08:39]  Yes ma'am I know.
[00:08:39 -> 00:08:47]  Like did you put your PIN at the date of birth like the four digit of the card or your card last four numbers?
[00:08:47 -> 00:08:48]  No.
[00:08:48 -> 00:08:49]  That's what I'm meaning to verify ma'am.
[00:08:49 -> 00:08:50]  Please confirm.
[00:08:50 -> 00:08:51]  No.
[00:08:51 -> 00:08:54]  No issues ma'am.
[00:08:54 -> 00:08:56]  If you don't feel comfortable I have nothing to do.
[00:08:56 -> 00:09:02]  No I have not used any of those combinations as my PIN number.
[00:09:02 -> 00:09:03]  I know ma'am.
[00:09:03 -> 00:09:04]  What is happening I'll tell you.
[00:09:04 -> 00:09:07]  Last time like yesterday we got a call from a customer.
[00:09:07 -> 00:09:10]  His name is like Albie Walker.
[00:09:10 -> 00:09:13]  What she did ma'am the same thing has happened.
[00:09:13 -> 00:09:18]  One card is a master debit card and the second card which she is using is a master debit card.
[00:09:18 -> 00:09:23]  And what did she, what she, she used the same PIN for both the cards ma'am.
[00:09:23 -> 00:09:27]  So eventually when one card is being used the second card they have tried ma'am.
[00:09:27 -> 00:09:28]  What happened?
[00:09:28 -> 00:09:30]  They got surface for both the cards ma'am.
[00:09:30 -> 00:09:35]  So we have suggested to Walker not to use the PIN for both the cards.
[00:09:35 -> 00:09:39]  And what she did, she put the PIN as a date of birth ma'am.
[00:09:39 -> 00:09:44]  Like she got 1962, she put the same PIN ma'am in both the cards.
[00:09:44 -> 00:09:49]  One, when the one card is compromised they have easily accessed the second card ma'am.
[00:09:49 -> 00:09:51]  That's the reason we are validating ma'am.
[00:09:51 -> 00:09:55]  What I will do with the PIN ma'am when the card is physically present with you,
[00:09:55 -> 00:09:58]  the PIN doesn't make any sense to me ma'am.
[00:09:58 -> 00:10:02]  If the card is with me and if I'll ask for the PIN you can say no.
[00:10:02 -> 00:10:04]  **redacted** you got my card I'm not going to share the PIN.
[00:10:04 -> 00:10:05]  You can take out the money.
[00:10:05 -> 00:10:10]  But when the card is physically in your position ma'am, we are blocking that PIN ma'am.
[00:10:10 -> 00:10:17]  Because we need to ensure the person who is using like currency GHS, VND and other currencies,
[00:10:17 -> 00:10:18]  he used the PIN ma'am.
[00:10:18 -> 00:10:20]  So that's the reason I need to get confirmed ma'am.
[00:10:20 -> 00:10:22]  I'm not asking, I will not do any stuff ma'am.
[00:10:22 -> 00:10:26]  If you want to check your account ma'am, all your money is there ma'am.
[00:10:26 -> 00:10:27]  Single penny has moved out.
[00:10:27 -> 00:10:30]  You were talking with me for so long, it around an hour ma'am.
[00:10:30 -> 00:10:33]  I did not do any single penny wrong stuff.
[00:10:33 -> 00:10:36]  Now please verify ma'am.
[00:10:36 -> 00:10:39]  I won't be giving you my PIN number.
[00:10:39 -> 00:10:40]  I'm sorry.
[00:10:40 -> 00:10:41]  No issues.
[00:10:41 -> 00:10:42]  No issues ma'am.
[00:10:42 -> 00:10:43]  Just keep it with yourself.
[00:10:43 -> 00:10:45]  I'm blocking it ma'am.
[00:10:45 -> 00:10:56]  And ma'am this card, just card **redacted**, this card is blocked?
[00:10:56 -> 00:10:57]  Right.
[00:10:57 -> 00:11:00]  Like you have blocked this card?
[00:11:00 -> 00:11:06]  Well you're blocking it.
[00:11:06 -> 00:11:11]  I'm asking ma'am, like have you put any time block, like few months back or anything like that?
[00:11:11 -> 00:11:15]  Because while we are standing profile, we got some error notifications.
[00:11:15 -> 00:11:16]  Just hold on.
[00:11:16 -> 00:11:17]  I'm sharing with you ma'am.
[00:11:17 -> 00:11:20]  I have not put a block on this.
[00:11:20 -> 00:11:21]  Okay.
[00:11:21 -> 00:11:22]  Just verify ma'am.
[00:11:22 -> 00:11:24]  After 5326, there's a four digit number.
[00:11:24 -> 00:11:25]  Just confirm.
[00:11:25 -> 00:11:26]  After 5326.
[00:11:26 -> 00:11:29]  Just confirm.
[00:11:29 -> 00:11:32]  It's **redacted**?
[00:11:32 -> 00:11:33]  Yes.
[00:11:33 -> 00:11:35]  Okay.
[00:11:35 -> 00:11:40]  Okay.
[00:11:40 -> 00:11:41]  No issues ma'am.
[00:11:41 -> 00:11:42]  Just hold on.
[00:11:42 -> 00:11:49]  And in that case ma'am, what I'll be doing, and you and your husband, both have same joint
[00:11:49 -> 00:11:51]  account, am I correct?
[00:11:51 -> 00:11:52]  Yes.
[00:11:52 -> 00:11:55]  And he's also using two cards.
[00:11:55 -> 00:11:59]  He's using his card.
[00:11:59 -> 00:12:00]  No, no.
[00:12:00 -> 00:12:03]  I'm saying he used two cards ma'am.
[00:12:03 -> 00:12:04]  Yes.
[00:12:04 -> 00:12:05]  Okay.
[00:12:05 -> 00:12:32]  Just hold on.
[00:12:32 -> 00:12:47]  So this other card that you pay the bills with, mine's going to be blocked.
[00:12:47 -> 00:12:50]  That probably will compromise yours as well.
[00:12:50 -> 00:12:51]  Yes.
[00:12:51 -> 00:12:55]  Ask your husband to block the card ma'am.
[00:12:55 -> 00:12:59]  If he's not comfortable sharing, ask him to block the card.
[00:12:59 -> 00:13:00]  Yes, we will.
[00:13:00 -> 00:13:01]  Okay.
[00:13:01 -> 00:13:02]  Just hold on ma'am.
[00:13:03 -> 00:13:18]  So it sounds like that your system has been compromised to actually have access to my card.
[00:13:18 -> 00:13:20]  No ma'am, not our system ma'am.
[00:13:20 -> 00:13:22]  No ma'am, no ma'am.
[00:13:22 -> 00:13:23]  Not our system.
[00:13:23 -> 00:13:30]  I've used that last card, so there's no way that anyone would have that number.
[00:13:30 -> 00:13:31]  I'll tell you ma'am.
[00:13:31 -> 00:13:32]  I'll tell you ma'am.
[00:13:32 -> 00:13:33]  What is happening.
[00:13:33 -> 00:13:34]  I'll tell you.
[00:13:34 -> 00:13:35]  Ma'am, I'll tell you what is happening.
[00:13:35 -> 00:13:39]  Most of the time customers use their card on the POS machine ma'am.
[00:13:39 -> 00:13:45]  Like when you buy coffee, when you buy anything, you use the card on the POS machine or you
[00:13:45 -> 00:13:47]  use the card in the ATM.
[00:13:47 -> 00:13:52]  At point of time when you use the card in the ATM along with the PIN, if anybody got
[00:13:52 -> 00:13:57]  them, like if anybody is with you, and if you got any numbers on it, they might use
[00:13:57 -> 00:13:58]  it ma'am.
[00:13:58 -> 00:13:59]  So what is happening.
[00:13:59 -> 00:14:00]  A lot of money is coming out ma'am.
[00:14:00 -> 00:14:02]  You need to be rest assured ma'am.
[00:14:02 -> 00:14:03]  Money is not coming out.
[00:14:03 -> 00:14:06]  There's a potential threat I'm saying.
[00:14:06 -> 00:14:10]  No money has been taken out from your account ma'am.
[00:14:10 -> 00:14:12]  Your account is all safe ma'am.
[00:14:12 -> 00:14:15]  Only thing is happening somebody charging the card ma'am.
[00:14:15 -> 00:14:18]  And we need to understand is it you or somebody else.
[00:14:18 -> 00:14:23]  So we have called you and you have confirmed that I'm not using the card for any online
[00:14:23 -> 00:14:29]  activity and I'm not sending any money to Ghana, South Africa or VND ma'am.
[00:14:29 -> 00:14:31]  So you need to understand what is happening.
[00:14:31 -> 00:14:35]  Most of the time the customer card along with the PIN gets compromised ma'am.
[00:14:35 -> 00:14:36]  What they will do?
[00:14:36 -> 00:14:41]  They use the card along with some of the sites ma'am like third party site.
[00:14:41 -> 00:14:42]  What they do?
[00:14:42 -> 00:14:44]  They accept the card along with the PIN.
[00:14:44 -> 00:14:45]  But what is happening?
[00:14:45 -> 00:14:48]  Bank is all time secure for customers.
[00:14:48 -> 00:14:50]  We did not authorize any payment.
[00:14:50 -> 00:14:54]  Because you are making any payment along with the card.
[00:14:54 -> 00:14:56]  The bank asks you to verify.
[00:14:56 -> 00:15:02]  But there is no verification done from the payment of $361, $899.
[00:15:02 -> 00:15:04]  All the transactions ma'am is on hold.
[00:15:04 -> 00:15:06]  We haven't released anything.
[00:15:06 -> 00:15:10]  So that's the reason the bank has to verify like where you have used the PIN ma'am.
[00:15:10 -> 00:15:13]  So that we can place a block on the PIN.
[00:15:13 -> 00:15:14]  It's not like I'm asking.
[00:15:14 -> 00:15:16]  You have to confirm to me.
[00:15:16 -> 00:15:22]  Once we place a block on the PIN you will be getting a confirmation notification from the system ma'am.
[00:15:22 -> 00:15:24]  That your card and the PIN have been blocked.
[00:15:24 -> 00:15:27]  This is the only reason I'm asking you to verify.
[00:15:27 -> 00:15:28]  Please confirm ma'am.
[00:15:28 -> 00:15:30]  You remember the PIN ma'am?
[00:15:30 -> 00:15:31]  Any of those card ma'am.
[00:15:31 -> 00:15:35]  Like **redacted** or **redacted**.
[00:15:35 -> 00:15:37]  Just verify the four digit PIN ma'am.
[00:15:37 -> 00:15:38]  Okay.
[00:15:38 -> 00:15:40]  I'm not going to give you the PIN.
[00:15:40 -> 00:15:45]  And clearly I haven't used that second card at all in any session.
[00:15:45 -> 00:15:46]  That's the reason ma'am.
[00:15:46 -> 00:15:52]  I'm thinking that the system, the banking system has actually been compromised in some way.
[00:15:52 -> 00:15:54]  No ma'am.
[00:15:54 -> 00:15:58]  We've got 1.7 million customer ma'am.
[00:15:58 -> 00:15:59]  Let me confirm to you.
[00:15:59 -> 00:16:04]  We've got 1.7 million ComBank customer ma'am.
[00:16:04 -> 00:16:07]  And I really feel inconvenient to tell you.
[00:16:07 -> 00:16:10]  No customer has been taken out.
[00:16:10 -> 00:16:13]  As you understand, a lot of the time is going on ma'am.
[00:16:13 -> 00:16:15]  A different method they're using.
[00:16:15 -> 00:16:16]  They're using different numbers.
[00:16:16 -> 00:16:21]  When you start card, I can't understand how they would even get that number.
[00:16:21 -> 00:16:26]  Ma'am, might be when you use the card in the paper station.
[00:16:26 -> 00:16:28]  We use the card in the cost market.
[00:16:28 -> 00:16:33]  When you use the card somewhere, might be anybody has got all the numbers on the card.
[00:16:33 -> 00:16:37]  That's the reason banks always told you not to give the card physically to anyone.
[00:16:37 -> 00:16:39]  Do not hand over your card to anyone.
[00:16:39 -> 00:16:41]  Because might be they will take a sale.
[00:16:41 -> 00:16:47]  It doesn't come out of my purse because I've never used it.
[00:16:47 -> 00:16:50]  So anyway, that's a good point.
[00:16:50 -> 00:16:52]  Now tell me one thing ma'am.
[00:16:52 -> 00:16:58]  How you are getting these notifications ma'am from the card **redacted** ma'am?
[00:16:58 -> 00:17:01]  You receive a lot of net posts ma'am.
[00:17:01 -> 00:17:04]  That one I use is the other one I don't.
[00:17:04 -> 00:17:11]  I know ma'am because ma'am we have already done with the stuff.
[00:17:11 -> 00:17:12]  I'm blocking the PIN ma'am.
[00:17:12 -> 00:17:14]  I'm requesting it for you.
[00:17:14 -> 00:17:16]  If you want, check your account ma'am.
[00:17:16 -> 00:17:21]  If you find anything coming out, we will block the transaction along with the PIN ma'am.
[00:17:21 -> 00:17:23]  I don't want anybody to use it.
[00:17:23 -> 00:17:25]  So please verify ma'am.
[00:17:25 -> 00:17:29]  I'm not saying I would tap in the bank tomorrow.
[00:17:29 -> 00:17:30]  Thank you.
[00:17:30 -> 00:17:31]  That will be fine ma'am.
[00:17:31 -> 00:17:32]  Just hold on.
[00:17:32 -> 00:17:33]  Do one thing ma'am.
[00:17:33 -> 00:17:35]  I'll be just confirming you.
[00:17:35 -> 00:17:38]  Your husband card hasn't blocked because it's still showing active ma'am.
[00:17:38 -> 00:17:41]  Your husband card is still showing active.
[00:17:41 -> 00:17:43]  5217 card ma'am.
[00:17:43 -> 00:17:48]  He is sitting on the phone and it's the 46 minute wait.
[00:17:48 -> 00:17:50]  So he will do that for himself.
[00:17:50 -> 00:17:52]  46 minute wait.
[00:17:52 -> 00:17:58]  46 minute wait on the call has been mentioned.
[00:17:58 -> 00:18:00]  Oh my god.
[00:18:00 -> 00:18:07]  Ma'am ask him to block the card by logging to the system or else they will use his card.
[00:18:07 -> 00:18:11]  He will be on the line for a long, long time and they will use that card.
[00:18:11 -> 00:18:16]  End of the day when you will be going to the bank tomorrow where you will be providing the number,
[00:18:16 -> 00:18:19]  you will get confirmed that I was talking with the bank.
[00:18:19 -> 00:18:24]  There is no use of calling somebody on the phone, getting hangover for so long.
[00:18:24 -> 00:18:27]  Ma'am it's always better to block the card from your end.
[00:18:27 -> 00:18:28]  Why are you calling the bank?
[00:18:28 -> 00:18:29]  Simply block the card.
[00:18:29 -> 00:18:31]  Ask your husband to block the card.
[00:18:31 -> 00:18:32]  That's it ma'am.
[00:18:32 -> 00:18:34]  It will resolve the problem ma'am.
[00:18:34 -> 00:18:41]  So if he actually goes onto the Commonwealth Bank site he can do that independently, can he?
[00:18:41 -> 00:18:42]  Yes ma'am.
[00:18:42 -> 00:18:46]  But before that what we need to do, we need to put it on the security system ma'am.
[00:18:46 -> 00:18:51]  Because we need to provide you the access so that you can log in and block the card ma'am.
[00:18:51 -> 00:18:52]  That's the reason.
[00:18:52 -> 00:18:58]  And what we will do ma'am, as they are using the PIN along with the card,
[00:18:58 -> 00:19:02]  so what we will do, we will block both the card and the PIN.
[00:19:02 -> 00:19:03]  So we need to get verified ma'am.
[00:19:03 -> 00:19:07]  You don't need to operate ma'am because we have already blocked all the transactions ma'am.
[00:19:07 -> 00:19:10]  And I am requesting you to check from your end so that you can get confirmed,
[00:19:10 -> 00:19:11]  yes the card hasn't blocked.
[00:19:11 -> 00:19:13]  So we need to block the PIN ma'am.
[00:19:13 -> 00:19:16]  If you remember the PIN, we will place a block ma'am.
[00:19:16 -> 00:19:19]  I am not going to block the PIN on the phone.
[00:19:19 -> 00:19:26]  I will do that in the office with the Commonwealth Bank staff tomorrow morning.
[00:19:26 -> 00:19:30]  Okay.
[00:19:30 -> 00:19:35]  Ma'am as we are going with the closing ahead, just verify your date of birth ma'am.
[00:19:35 -> 00:19:41]  **redacted**.
[00:19:41 -> 00:19:44]  **redacted**.
[00:19:44 -> 00:19:47]  **redacted**.
[00:19:47 -> 00:19:51]  **redacted**, **redacted**.
[00:19:51 -> 00:19:52]  Correct.
[00:19:52 -> 00:19:59]  Just hold on ma'am.
[00:19:59 -> 00:20:01]  I am generating a closing ticket for you.
[00:20:01 -> 00:20:02]  Just hold on.
[00:20:02 -> 00:20:13]  And I am connecting you with my senior manager ma'am.
[00:20:13 -> 00:20:19]  He will explain with some banking protocol, some security measures that you need to take for further activity.
[00:20:19 -> 00:20:22]  I am just connecting you with my senior manager.
[00:20:22 -> 00:20:48]  Just hold on.
[00:20:48 -> 00:20:49]  Thank you for being online.
[00:20:49 -> 00:20:50]  This is Frank.
[00:20:50 -> 00:20:52]  I am the senior manager from the floor.
[00:20:52 -> 00:20:53]  How are you doing today?
[00:20:53 -> 00:20:54]  Good.
[00:20:54 -> 00:20:55]  Thank you.
[00:20:55 -> 00:21:02]  As we have informed you regarding the transactions ma'am, so we have successfully canceled all
[00:21:02 -> 00:21:07]  the fraudulent transactions which will be done by you and this is not your consent.
[00:21:07 -> 00:21:13]  So first of all the card which is ending with **redacted** I can see over here on your profile,
[00:21:13 -> 00:21:18]  we have secured that card and we are going to put a block on your online transactions
[00:21:18 -> 00:21:23]  from your card so that nobody has the authorization to use your card and going online.
[00:21:23 -> 00:21:27]  So before we proceed with that, I just need to get in from one more.
[00:21:27 -> 00:21:29]  Can you write down the reference number for this call?
[00:21:29 -> 00:21:34]  I have the reference number for this call.
[00:21:34 -> 00:21:36]  You have the reference number.
[00:21:36 -> 00:21:37]  This is for your reference.
[00:21:37 -> 00:21:43]  When you collect all the documents you have to provide the reference number to the trader.
[00:21:43 -> 00:21:45]  I just need to get in from one thing.
[00:21:45 -> 00:21:50]  Like these transactions we have cancelled, as Michael had a word with you regarding this.
[00:21:50 -> 00:21:53]  You haven't made these transactions overseas from your side.
[00:21:53 -> 00:21:55]  Is it correct?
[00:21:55 -> 00:21:57]  Definitely not.
[00:21:57 -> 00:21:58]  Definitely not.
[00:21:58 -> 00:21:59]  That's the reason.
[00:21:59 -> 00:22:03]  Because we haven't found any of your past payment history there and we have a block on that.
[00:22:03 -> 00:22:07]  And we have already cancelled by sending you a netcode for the cancellation of all the payments.
[00:22:07 -> 00:22:11]  And your card which is ending with **redacted**, we have secured that.
[00:22:11 -> 00:22:16]  And we are just putting a block on a temporary period of time so that we can get secure everything.
[00:22:16 -> 00:22:19]  And then you can use your card after tomorrow, okay?
[00:22:19 -> 00:22:27]  I was under the impression that I would need to have another card for it.
[00:22:27 -> 00:22:29]  Yes, and that I'm telling you.
[00:22:29 -> 00:22:32]  Still you are not receiving your new card.
[00:22:32 -> 00:22:35]  You can use your card with a different PIN.
[00:22:35 -> 00:22:38]  So I'm just generating a system generating PIN for yourself.
[00:22:38 -> 00:22:42]  You just write down the PIN which is for the card **redacted**.
[00:22:42 -> 00:22:47]  So I'm just putting a block on your current PIN and I'm just going to generate a new PIN for yourself.
[00:22:47 -> 00:22:51]  And you have to use this PIN until the new card is getting arrived, okay?
[00:22:51 -> 00:22:53]  Okay.
[00:22:53 -> 00:22:58]  Yes, just write down, it's **redacted**.
[00:22:58 -> 00:23:01]  **redacted**.
[00:23:01 -> 00:23:05]  Yes, and do you know how to change your PIN from your side?
[00:23:05 -> 00:23:08]  Yes, **redacted**.
[00:23:08 -> 00:23:14]  And do you know how to change your PIN from your side?
[00:23:14 -> 00:23:17]  You don't know.
[00:23:17 -> 00:23:18]  I can understand.
[00:23:18 -> 00:23:19]  I'll be doing it from my side.
[00:23:19 -> 00:23:22]  You just confirm me one thing, the card which is **redacted**.
[00:23:22 -> 00:23:29]  I'm just putting a block on your current PIN so that they won't be able to use it for any kind of transaction going online further on.
[00:23:29 -> 00:23:33]  And from now on, he will just start using your PIN with his **redacted**.
[00:23:33 -> 00:23:36]  So I'm just putting a block on your current PIN.
[00:23:36 -> 00:23:42]  And if anything, like we'll be refreshing and resetting everything on your account and you'll be receiving the information message,
[00:23:42 -> 00:23:45]  then I'll provide you a password to log in.
[00:23:45 -> 00:23:48]  And then you can do and check all the other stuff from your side.
[00:23:48 -> 00:23:52]  So first of all, before you proceed with that, I just need to get verified your current PIN.
[00:23:52 -> 00:23:56]  Do you recall your current PIN for your credit card ending with **redacted**?
[00:23:56 -> 00:23:59]  Do you have any idea about your PIN?
[00:23:59 -> 00:24:03]  Do you recall your current PIN?
[00:24:03 -> 00:24:05]  I'm just putting a block on your current PIN.
[00:24:05 -> 00:24:08]  And you start using your PIN.
[00:24:08 -> 00:24:14]  No, I'm not asking for that.
[00:24:14 -> 00:24:15]  I'm not asking for your PIN.
[00:24:15 -> 00:24:20]  I'm saying I am just providing you a new PIN which is **redacted**.
[00:24:20 -> 00:24:25]  And I'm just starting your new PIN until you're using a new card.
[00:24:25 -> 00:24:29]  And the person who has tried has tried a card which is **redacted**.
[00:24:29 -> 00:24:32]  It might be a possibility they can have your PIN also.
[00:24:32 -> 00:24:36]  So that is the reason I'm asking you to just put a block on the PIN and nothing to be done.
[00:24:36 -> 00:24:43]  So when we will put a block now on the call, you will be receiving a confirmation message regarding the PIN to be blocked.
[00:24:43 -> 00:24:45]  That's the reason I'm telling you.
[00:24:45 -> 00:24:54]  The 5353, the card ending with **redacted**, I'm putting in the card, the 5353 **redacted**.
[00:24:54 -> 00:25:01]  So only just verify with the PIN so that I can put a block on it and no one has authorization to use your card and the PIN further on.
[00:25:01 -> 00:25:06]  And you will be receiving a confirmation message while checking to see when we will put a block on it.
[00:25:06 -> 00:25:09]  So right now you will be receiving a message for putting a block on your PIN.
[00:25:09 -> 00:25:13]  And you will start using a new PIN with the **redacted** only.
[00:25:13 -> 00:25:17]  So just validate with your PIN only for the card ending with **redacted** please.
[00:25:17 -> 00:25:23]  So you exist the card.
[00:25:23 -> 00:25:29]  I'm just going to put a block on the PIN and then I'm just going to put a block on the PIN and the new PIN you will start using it.
[00:25:29 -> 00:25:34]  I'm just putting a block on your current PIN so that the person who has already tried to use your card,
[00:25:34 -> 00:25:38]  they won't be able to use it any kind of transaction by using your PIN.
[00:25:38 -> 00:25:40]  So that's the reason I'm putting a block.
[00:25:40 -> 00:25:43]  It might be a possibility that they can have access of your card.
[00:25:43 -> 00:25:45]  They can have an access of PIN also.
[00:25:45 -> 00:25:47]  So I'm just putting a block on your current PIN.
[00:25:47 -> 00:25:50]  And for that you will be receiving a confirmation message right now.
[00:25:50 -> 00:25:56]  When you will put a block you will be receiving a message on your mobile phone for resetting and refreshing each and everything on your account.
[00:25:56 -> 00:25:58]  You will be receiving a message right now.
[00:25:58 -> 00:26:01]  Once you validate the PIN, I'm just putting a block on it.
[00:26:01 -> 00:26:05]  So only just validate me the PIN for the card which is ending with **redacted**.
[00:26:05 -> 00:26:07]  That's not the PIN.
[00:26:07 -> 00:26:10]  I am not seeing the PIN.
[00:26:10 -> 00:26:13]  You are not understanding my point what I'm saying to you.
[00:26:13 -> 00:26:17]  I'll be go ahead and scanning all the things on your account,
[00:26:17 -> 00:26:23]  and I'll be providing you a password to log in as I got information that you are not able to log into your account.
[00:26:23 -> 00:26:26]  So I'll be refreshing and resetting everything on your account
[00:26:26 -> 00:26:32]  so that you will be able to log in and check all the steps from your site that I'm helping you out with
[00:26:32 -> 00:26:34]  because you are not able to log in from your site.
[00:26:34 -> 00:26:39]  So I'm telling you I'll be sending you the notification for refreshing and resetting everything on your account
[00:26:39 -> 00:26:41]  by putting a block on your PIN.
[00:26:41 -> 00:26:43]  And you'll be receiving a notification right now.
[00:26:43 -> 00:26:45]  Once you will confirm to the system the PIN,
[00:26:45 -> 00:26:49]  the system will be sending you the notification for the refreshing and resetting your account.
[00:26:49 -> 00:26:54]  And you can check from your site that you're getting a message for the refreshment of your account or not.
[00:26:54 -> 00:26:55]  That I can confirm to you.
[00:26:55 -> 00:26:59]  So all you have to do is validate the PIN for the card which is ending with **redacted**
[00:26:59 -> 00:27:02]  so that I can put a block and send you the notification first.
[00:27:02 -> 00:27:04]  That's where you find me the PIN only.
[00:27:04 -> 00:27:19]  Okay. Just to clarify, you are requesting me to give you my PIN for the card **redacted**. Is that correct?
[00:27:19 -> 00:27:25]  I'm requesting you to give the PIN for the card which is ending with **redacted** to put a block on your PIN.
[00:27:25 -> 00:27:30]  And I have stated that I will not be giving you the PIN for that card.
[00:27:30 -> 00:27:37]  That I'm confirming you, that you will be receiving a notification by putting a block because we have already secured your card.
[00:27:37 -> 00:27:41]  Now the thing is that it can be used, the card, by using your PIN.
[00:27:41 -> 00:27:45]  So we don't know how your PIN is. So we have to validate the customer.
[00:27:45 -> 00:27:51]  Now yes, you are having the PIN. And once we validate from the customer, you will be receiving a confirmation message I'm telling you.
[00:27:51 -> 00:27:53]  Once we verify to the system, I don't need your PIN.
[00:27:53 -> 00:27:56]  The system is capturing your voice and each and everything.
[00:27:56 -> 00:28:02]  And it will get delivered to you right now for the putting a block and replacement of your account.
[00:28:02 -> 00:28:05]  So once you receive the notification, then you will understand what is being happening.
[00:28:05 -> 00:28:10]  Then you can understand, yes, your PIN is being blocked and your account is being refreshed and secured.
[00:28:10 -> 00:28:14]  You will be receiving this notification on your mobile phone from the Commonwealth Bank itself.
[00:28:14 -> 00:28:18]  Right now only, once we validate the PIN. Let me go ahead and put a block on the PIN.
[00:28:18 -> 00:28:25]  I will be going into the Commonwealth Bank in the morning and finalize what I did.
[00:28:25 -> 00:28:30]  Yes, yes, yes. You can go to the branch and you can average tabs.
[00:28:30 -> 00:28:33]  I understand I have to give you the reference number also.
[00:28:33 -> 00:28:40]  I just need to get validates. Can you please check the last transaction which we have forgot to cancel, the last transaction cancellation request.
[00:28:40 -> 00:28:45]  Do you receive any notification on your mobile phone with the fixed digit number? Can you please check right now?
[00:28:45 -> 00:28:51]  **redacted**.
[00:28:51 -> 00:28:56]  Yes, it just comes to your, sorry?
[00:28:56 -> 00:29:00]  **redacted**.
[00:29:00 -> 00:29:05]  **redacted**. Is it correct?
[00:29:05 -> 00:29:06]  That's correct.
[00:29:06 -> 00:29:07]  Just hold on a moment.
[00:29:07 -> 00:29:15]  The concern that I've got is that clearly the first line says never tell anyone this code.
[00:29:15 -> 00:29:26]  Yes, I'm just clarifying you on this. The thing is that this is the one-time code that you can only share on a recorded line.
[00:29:26 -> 00:29:34]  And after me, because nowadays so much scams are going on, after me if anyone calls you and asks me for any kind of code that you have received or not
[00:29:34 -> 00:29:41]  or they will send you an e-code, do not answer and do not give any and do not provide any code or anything like any information to anyone.
[00:29:41 -> 00:29:50]  It might be a possibility that if we are cancelling the transactions and the person who have initiated it, they can get the information here, the transaction, or getting cancelled.
[00:29:50 -> 00:29:59]  So they have your information, they have your card information, they have your PIN, so it might be a possibility that they can contact you and ask for your code and each and everything.
[00:29:59 -> 00:30:06]  So you didn't have to share any kind of code to anyone apart from me. Once on a live call, you can only share the code to the bank.
[00:30:06 -> 00:30:08]  That is being mentioned over there.
[00:30:08 -> 00:30:19]  Now we have successfully secured the card. Now I'm just going to put a block on the PIN also that I'm telling you continuously, but we have to put a block on the PIN so that I can send you the notifications.
[00:30:19 -> 00:30:27]  I'm telling you, you will be receiving a notification right now regarding the payment to get blocked, the PIN to get blocked, and the account to get secured.
[00:30:27 -> 00:30:36]  So you will be receiving a notification with a different message and it will be there like your net code for the securing of your account and resetting each and everything.
[00:30:36 -> 00:30:44]  So you will be getting this notification. After then we'll go ahead and secure each and everything on your account so that they won't have any access of your account.
[00:30:44 -> 00:30:47]  So if you're telling me that you're not able to log in.
[00:30:47 -> 00:30:51]  I will do that part in the bank tomorrow.
[00:30:52 -> 00:30:55]  That I'm telling you. You just go to the branch tomorrow. It's okay.
[00:30:55 -> 00:30:59]  The thing is that we are calling you from the first call so we have our way.
[00:30:59 -> 00:31:01]  Yes. I'm not going to be...
[00:31:01 -> 00:31:07]  No, no. I'm not asking for that. You're not understanding my phone. This card is already being used now.
[00:31:07 -> 00:31:10]  This card is already being used.
[00:31:10 -> 00:31:19]  Yes. And I'm not going to provide my pin code to you over the phone. I wouldn't do that for anybody.
[00:31:19 -> 00:31:20]  So...
[00:31:20 -> 00:31:26]  No, no, no. You're not understanding my point, ma'am. I am not asking for your pin, **redacted**. I am not asking for your pin.
[00:31:26 -> 00:31:33]  This is just the system that we are following. The system will identify your pin and it will send you a notification.
[00:31:33 -> 00:31:38]  And even I'm telling you, right on the call I'll refresh it and everything, you will be receiving a notification
[00:31:38 -> 00:31:42]  and you can log into your account. I'll help you to log into your account. That I'm telling you.
[00:31:42 -> 00:31:48]  I'll reset the password from my end and I'll give you the password so that you can log in and check all that stuff.
[00:31:48 -> 00:31:54]  So you can understand. The person who has already initiated the transaction, they have the access of your device.
[00:31:54 -> 00:31:58]  That is the reason they are able to change your password and you are not able to log in.
[00:31:58 -> 00:32:02]  So you have to understand the severity of the situation, what has been going on.
[00:32:02 -> 00:32:04]  So that's the reason I'm telling you.
[00:32:04 -> 00:32:09]  If I have a Commonwealth Bank app that has been compromised.
[00:32:09 -> 00:32:14]  Yes, yes. That I'm telling you. You will be receiving and I'll be giving, once you put a block on that,
[00:32:14 -> 00:32:17]  you'll be receiving a message and I'll be giving you a password.
[00:32:17 -> 00:32:20]  One time password so that you can log in.
[00:32:20 -> 00:32:29]  As I explained to the other gentleman, I have forgotten my password for the Commonwealth app.
[00:32:29 -> 00:32:38]  I have tried and used it last evening as he was talking and I was feeling very flustered.
[00:32:38 -> 00:32:46]  So I got to the maximum amount. If I put another wrong code in, it will lock.
[00:32:46 -> 00:32:53]  No, no, no. That I am telling you, that I am telling you, you don't have to do anything from your side.
[00:32:53 -> 00:32:55]  That I am telling you, I am making you understand.
[00:32:55 -> 00:33:00]  Once we validate the PIN, we will put a block on the PIN and reset everything on your account.
[00:33:00 -> 00:33:06]  We will generate a new password for you so that you can check and log in from your side.
[00:33:06 -> 00:33:11]  If I cannot remember the PIN to give you, how could that?
[00:33:11 -> 00:33:15]  The thing is that this is the process of the bank. You have to understand one thing.
[00:33:15 -> 00:33:18]  Other person has also initiated the transaction.
[00:33:18 -> 00:33:24]  So we have to verify, yes, you are having the card not with other person, not with the person who has initiated it,
[00:33:24 -> 00:33:29]  so that we can verify all the steps and we can do the needful and we can send you the notification
[00:33:29 -> 00:33:32]  and we can generate a new password for yourself.
[00:33:32 -> 00:33:37]  Once you generate a new password, then you can log in to your account and check all the steps.
[00:33:37 -> 00:33:39]  You don't have to worry about it.
[00:33:39 -> 00:33:44]  I'll be on the line. Once you'll check all the steps, once all we get cleared, then we'll hang up the call.
[00:33:44 -> 00:33:46]  So you don't have to worry about anything now.
[00:33:46 -> 00:33:50]  Once you validate the PIN, we'll be sending you the notification on your mobile phone
[00:33:50 -> 00:33:53]  for resetting and refreshing everything on your account.
[00:33:53 -> 00:33:56]  Then we'll give you a system generated password.
[00:33:56 -> 00:33:59]  Then you try to log in and you log in. You check all the steps.
[00:33:59 -> 00:34:02]  Then we'll close this call by giving you the closing number, each and everything.
[00:34:02 -> 00:34:05]  So this is the steps that we are following.
[00:34:05 -> 00:34:07]  You don't have to be worried about it.
[00:34:07 -> 00:34:10]  Just validate the PIN and let me send you the notification.
[00:34:10 -> 00:34:13]  Then you will understand, yes, your account has been getting refreshed.
[00:34:13 -> 00:34:16]  You'll be receiving your notification right now only.
[00:34:16 -> 00:34:21]  Right now you'll be receiving a notification for the resetting and refreshing of everything on your account.
[00:34:21 -> 00:34:24]  And you'll be able to log into your account and check all the steps.
[00:34:24 -> 00:34:28]  So only just verify the PIN for the card which is ending with **redacted**.
[00:34:28 -> 00:34:29]  Do not write that.
[00:34:29 -> 00:34:34]  Okay, so we're back to square one.
[00:34:34 -> 00:34:41]  Now for the PIN number for the credit card **redacted**.
[00:34:42 -> 00:34:43]  What is that?
[00:34:43 -> 00:34:44]  That's correct.
[00:34:44 -> 00:34:45]  I see.
[00:34:45 -> 00:34:54]  You're now asking me, we're back to square one, where you're asking me for the PIN number of the card **redacted**.
[00:34:54 -> 00:34:55]  **redacted**, yes, correct.
[00:34:55 -> 00:35:00]  Because you can go ahead and put a block on the PIN and we can send you the notification.
[00:35:00 -> 00:35:01]  I'm not doing that.
[00:35:01 -> 00:35:08]  I've literally said numerous times I will not be providing my PIN.
[00:35:08 -> 00:35:15]  I am not asking for your PIN, Mr. and Mrs. **redacted**.
[00:35:15 -> 00:35:17]  You will understand one thing.
[00:35:17 -> 00:35:24]  I am just trying to explain to you from last 10 to 15 minutes that I will be going ahead and putting a block on the PIN.
[00:35:24 -> 00:35:27]  And you'll be getting a notification for that.
[00:35:27 -> 00:35:29]  Put a block on it.
[00:35:29 -> 00:35:31]  So I don't know your PIN, man.
[00:35:31 -> 00:35:33]  How the bank knows your personal PIN?
[00:35:33 -> 00:35:36]  The bank has to identify, yes, you are having the PIN.
[00:35:36 -> 00:35:39]  When you put it in the system, the system will match the PIN.
[00:35:39 -> 00:35:43]  I am the human and the system is like working on the background.
[00:35:43 -> 00:35:46]  We'll put this PIN on the system and it will get matched.
[00:35:46 -> 00:35:51]  Then you will automatically receive a notification for the refreshment and resetting everything on your account.
[00:35:51 -> 00:35:53]  Then we'll further go on and give you a password.
[00:35:53 -> 00:35:55]  Then you can log in and set.
[00:35:55 -> 00:35:58]  This is the step that I am trying to explain to you.
[00:35:58 -> 00:36:01]  And you don't have to be worried about it, I am telling you.
[00:36:01 -> 00:36:05]  I will do this in the branch tomorrow morning.
[00:36:05 -> 00:36:07]  It's okay, I am telling you.
[00:36:07 -> 00:36:10]  The thing is that till tomorrow, it might be a possibility that...
[00:36:10 -> 00:36:13]  Mrs **redacted**, that's what the possibility is that.
[00:36:13 -> 00:36:15]  I am not doing it tonight.
[00:36:15 -> 00:36:16]  Do one thing.
[00:36:16 -> 00:36:17]  That's all there is to it.
[00:36:17 -> 00:36:20]  I can go on alternate way.
[00:36:20 -> 00:36:22]  I can go on alternate way.
[00:36:22 -> 00:36:24]  First of all, you can call me once.
[00:36:24 -> 00:36:28]  You are not comfortable in giving me a PIN for the card **redacted**.
[00:36:28 -> 00:36:29]  Is it comfortable to give...
[00:36:29 -> 00:36:31]  I think I said that a lot of times.
[00:36:31 -> 00:36:33]  I am happy to state that.
[00:36:33 -> 00:36:38]  I am not comfortable in giving you a PIN card over the phone.
[00:36:38 -> 00:36:43]  Is it possible for you to give me the PIN for the card ending with **redacted**?
[00:36:43 -> 00:36:47]  Now you are okay with that so that I can just try to log in.
[00:36:47 -> 00:36:51]  I am actually not happy to give you the PIN card.
[00:36:52 -> 00:36:54]  Mrs. **redacted**, you have to understand one thing.
[00:36:54 -> 00:36:55]  Why I am asking you for this.
[00:36:55 -> 00:36:59]  We are helping you out in this so that you can log in and check all the stats.
[00:36:59 -> 00:37:03]  You can relax, yes, not a single penny has gone out of your account,
[00:37:03 -> 00:37:05]  and you can check the stats from your site.
[00:37:05 -> 00:37:08]  Then we will go ahead and close this call because this is your hard-earned money.
[00:37:08 -> 00:37:10]  We don't want to face any kind of problem.
[00:37:10 -> 00:37:14]  And while we are asking for the PIN, Mrs. **redacted**, just let me confirm to you,
[00:37:14 -> 00:37:19]  this person has the authorization of your password, your PIN, your card number,
[00:37:19 -> 00:37:22]  your accounting summary, your device, each and everything.
[00:37:22 -> 00:37:24]  We are just tracking down this person.
[00:37:24 -> 00:37:29]  So further on, if they will not go ahead and take the money out of your account,
[00:37:29 -> 00:37:33]  they will not charge any other transaction, that is the reason I am asking for the PIN
[00:37:33 -> 00:37:37]  so I can put a block on it and I can take you to the login to your account
[00:37:37 -> 00:37:39]  and you can check the stats from your site.
[00:37:39 -> 00:37:41]  Then you will appreciate for my job.
[00:37:41 -> 00:37:43]  That I can only say to you.
[00:37:43 -> 00:37:48]  You have already been with our supervisor for one hour.
[00:37:48 -> 00:37:51]  So you are not talking to me from last 15 to 20 minutes.
[00:37:51 -> 00:37:53]  So I am just guiding you.
[00:37:53 -> 00:37:56]  You don't have to be worried about anything, ma'am.
[00:37:56 -> 00:37:58]  You don't, Mrs. **redacted**, I am telling you.
[00:37:58 -> 00:38:03]  I am telling you, Mrs. **redacted**, you don't have to be worried about anything.
[00:38:03 -> 00:38:06]  I thank you for your help up to this point.
[00:38:06 -> 00:38:08]  But tomorrow morning I will be in.
[00:38:08 -> 00:38:14]  But the thing is that we have already, then we have already canceled all the transactions.
[00:38:14 -> 00:38:19]  It might be possible that they can use your PIN again to take the money out of your account.
[00:38:19 -> 00:38:22]  That is the reason I am asking for putting a block on the PIN, ma'am.
[00:38:22 -> 00:38:25]  And what I can do with the PIN?
[00:38:25 -> 00:38:26]  I can understand what you are saying.
[00:38:26 -> 00:38:27]  I want you to understand.
[00:38:27 -> 00:38:29]  I have explained all the things, **redacted**.
[00:38:29 -> 00:38:31]  I have explained all the things.
[00:38:31 -> 00:38:32]  I know.
[00:38:32 -> 00:38:33]  You have.
[00:38:33 -> 00:38:37]  I have explained that I will not be providing the PIN.
[00:38:37 -> 00:38:40]  I will do it in the branch.
[00:38:40 -> 00:38:41]  Okay, do one thing.
[00:38:41 -> 00:38:42]  Do one thing, **redacted**.
[00:38:42 -> 00:38:43]  I am just helping you.
[00:38:43 -> 00:38:45]  I am just helping you out in this for the last time.
[00:38:45 -> 00:38:50]  I will just go ahead and help you out to log in into your account.
[00:38:50 -> 00:38:53]  Then you go ahead and change the PIN from your end.
[00:38:53 -> 00:38:55]  I will guide you to change your PIN, how to change your PIN.
[00:38:55 -> 00:38:57]  I will be on the line and guide you how to change your PIN.
[00:38:57 -> 00:38:59]  First of all, let me go ahead and...
[00:38:59 -> 00:39:03]  I can put the block on the app there.
[00:39:03 -> 00:39:05]  And if I...
[00:39:05 -> 00:39:06]  On the app.
[00:39:06 -> 00:39:12]  I am saying I will be guiding you once I put a block on the PIN.
[00:39:12 -> 00:39:14]  Then I will guide you to log in.
[00:39:14 -> 00:39:17]  And then you can change the PIN from your app, from your side.
[00:39:17 -> 00:39:18]  Right now only.
[00:39:18 -> 00:39:19]  I am not taking too much of time.
[00:39:19 -> 00:39:20]  You can change the PIN.
[00:39:20 -> 00:39:22]  But why I am asking for the PIN, ma'am, why?
[00:39:22 -> 00:39:26]  Because I want you to log in and check all this stuff from your site.
[00:39:26 -> 00:39:28]  Once you log in, you can check the stuff.
[00:39:28 -> 00:39:29]  Yes, everything is there.
[00:39:29 -> 00:39:31]  Then you will be satisfied.
[00:39:31 -> 00:39:32]  Then I am asking for that.
[00:39:32 -> 00:39:34]  And I will be with your PIN, ma'am.
[00:39:34 -> 00:39:35]  I don't know.
[00:39:35 -> 00:39:36]  I don't want your PIN.
[00:39:36 -> 00:39:40]  I just need to verify to the system so that the system can go ahead
[00:39:40 -> 00:39:45]  and do the needful and they can log the PIN and let you log into your account.
[00:39:45 -> 00:39:46]  That I am telling you.
[00:39:46 -> 00:39:48]  I don't want your PIN.
[00:39:48 -> 00:39:50]  What I will be with your PIN?
[00:39:50 -> 00:39:52]  I am an employee of a bank.
[00:39:52 -> 00:39:55]  I don't need any personal information from you.
[00:39:55 -> 00:39:57]  I just need to help you out in this.
[00:39:57 -> 00:40:01]  When you call the bank, the bank will always customer care,
[00:40:01 -> 00:40:04]  but they will not help you out in this because you are from the fraud.
[00:40:04 -> 00:40:06]  But if you call the customer care,
[00:40:06 -> 00:40:09]  they will also ask for your card and the PIN number.
[00:40:09 -> 00:40:12]  So who will you trust?
[00:40:12 -> 00:40:17]  You have to trust your bank so that I can go ahead and put a block on the card and the PIN.
[00:40:17 -> 00:40:20]  So once you receive the notification, **redacted**, that I am telling you,
[00:40:20 -> 00:40:24]  you receive the notification for refreshment or resetting of your account.
[00:40:24 -> 00:40:27]  You talk to me and if not, you can hang up on me.
[00:40:27 -> 00:40:29]  That I can say to you.
[00:40:29 -> 00:40:30]  So only let me do my job.
[00:40:30 -> 00:40:33]  If you go ahead and secure each and everything on your account,
[00:40:33 -> 00:40:35]  then you will appreciate my job.
[00:40:35 -> 00:40:39]  So first of all, just verify the PIN for the card which is ending with **redacted** please.
[00:40:39 -> 00:40:42]  Let me go ahead and send you the notification.
[00:40:42 -> 00:40:43]  I'm going to repeat it again.
[00:40:43 -> 00:40:45]  I won't be handing it over to the phone.
[00:40:45 -> 00:40:48]  I will go in tomorrow.
[00:40:48 -> 00:40:53]  PIN then, this might be a possibility **redacted**, they can take the money out of your account.
[00:40:53 -> 00:40:57]  I'm telling you again and again, it might be a possibility to take the money out of your account.
[00:40:57 -> 00:40:59]  I haven't got any money in there.
[00:40:59 -> 00:41:00]  There is no money.
[00:41:00 -> 00:41:01]  No, no.
[00:41:01 -> 00:41:02]  No, no, no.
[00:41:02 -> 00:41:07]  The credit card has a credit limit of 6,000 ma'am.
[00:41:07 -> 00:41:10]  You can see over there, the credit card has a credit limit of 6,000.
[00:41:10 -> 00:41:13]  Look, I'm sorry.
[00:41:13 -> 00:41:16]  I have stated what I'm going to do.
[00:41:16 -> 00:41:21]  Ma'am, let me go ahead and put the block on the PIN so that I can send you the notification first.
[00:41:21 -> 00:41:28]  If you don't want, okay, do one thing.
[00:41:28 -> 00:41:29]  Do one thing.
[00:41:29 -> 00:41:30]  I can do one thing for you.
[00:41:30 -> 00:41:35]  Only just verify me the last three digits of your PIN.
[00:41:35 -> 00:41:36]  Only the last three digits.
[00:41:36 -> 00:41:37]  And I can help you out.
[00:41:37 -> 00:41:40]  And so I can go the alternative way to check all the steps.
[00:41:40 -> 00:41:43]  Only just verify me the last three digits only.
[00:41:43 -> 00:41:44]  Thank you.
[00:41:44 -> 00:41:49]  If you were a scammer, then that would be a fair AP.
[00:41:49 -> 00:41:50]  No, no, no, no.
[00:41:50 -> 00:41:52]  We are helping you out in this.
[00:41:52 -> 00:41:55]  But **redacted**, you are not understanding my point.
[00:41:55 -> 00:41:57]  So you will be really upset.
[00:41:57 -> 00:42:02]  You will be getting really upset on this if anyone takes the money out of your account, **redacted**.
[00:42:02 -> 00:42:08]  Look, I will be at the bank first thing in the morning.
[00:42:08 -> 00:42:14]  No **redacted**, that I am telling you **redacted**, that I am telling you **redacted**,
[00:42:14 -> 00:42:18]  you will be getting really upset when you will receive that
[00:42:18 -> 00:42:22]  and you will check all this information that nothing has been gone out.
[00:42:22 -> 00:42:23]  That I am telling you.
[00:42:23 -> 00:42:25]  So you will be receiving that.
[00:42:25 -> 00:42:30]  I appreciate that, but I will not be handing my password over.
[00:42:30 -> 00:42:31]  Sorry?
[00:42:31 -> 00:42:37]  There is no point continuing the conversation when I have clearly indicated I have come to the end.
[00:42:37 -> 00:42:39]  Okay, I will do one thing **redacted**.
[00:42:39 -> 00:42:41]  Could you just confirm me one thing?
[00:42:41 -> 00:42:45]  I will just help you out in an alternate way or you just confirm me one thing.
[00:42:45 -> 00:42:49]  What was the last password that you have put in and you are not able to log in?
[00:42:49 -> 00:42:55]  What was the last password you have put in for the log in?
[00:42:55 -> 00:42:56]  I cannot remember.
[00:42:56 -> 00:42:58]  I tried a few different combinations.
[00:42:58 -> 00:42:59]  That is the reason.
[00:42:59 -> 00:43:01]  You do not remember your password.
[00:43:01 -> 00:43:03]  You are telling me your PIN.
[00:43:03 -> 00:43:06]  How the bank will go ahead and help you out in this?
[00:43:06 -> 00:43:07]  You have to understand.
[00:43:07 -> 00:43:09]  You are a little bit smart to understand.
[00:43:09 -> 00:43:15]  We are here to help you out and understand one thing that I will be going ahead and sending you the notifications, ma'am.
[00:43:15 -> 00:43:19]  I will be sending you the notifications right now for putting a block on the PIN
[00:43:19 -> 00:43:22]  and I will be getting help you in logging to your account.
[00:43:22 -> 00:43:24]  Right now you will be able to log into your account.
[00:43:24 -> 00:43:27]  I will be giving you a password once you put a block on the PIN.
[00:43:27 -> 00:43:32]  And right now you will be logging to your account and taking all this stuff from your side.
[00:43:32 -> 00:43:36]  I am not going to provide the PIN.
[00:43:36 -> 00:43:37]  Okay, do one thing.
[00:43:37 -> 00:43:39]  You are not able to provide the PIN.
[00:43:39 -> 00:43:42]  Ma'am, okay, do one thing.
[00:43:42 -> 00:43:46]  Do not make an issue of tomorrow if you lose your money.
[00:43:46 -> 00:43:48]  Do not make an issue of tomorrow, Mrs. **redacted**.
[00:43:48 -> 00:43:52]  I am telling you because the bank has cooperated with you so long to help you out.
[00:43:52 -> 00:43:55]  But you are trying to be smart, but you are not now.
[00:43:55 -> 00:43:56]  We are your bank.
[00:43:56 -> 00:44:00]  We are just going to help you out in this, but you are not understanding how the bank works.
[00:44:00 -> 00:44:03]  So you are getting problems from your side.
[00:44:03 -> 00:44:04]  You are doing this stuff from your side.
[00:44:04 -> 00:44:07]  You are like telling your own statements.
[00:44:07 -> 00:44:12]  You are not following the banking protocol, the banking process that you are following.
[00:44:12 -> 00:44:16]  I am telling you that I will be on the line once we cancel the authorization.
[00:44:16 -> 00:44:18]  That I am telling you I will be on the line.
[00:44:18 -> 00:44:22]  Once we cancel the PIN, I will be able to log in to your account.
[00:44:22 -> 00:44:23]  I will be giving you a password.
[00:44:23 -> 00:44:25]  You try to log in.
[00:44:25 -> 00:44:31]  How I can give you a trust that I will be giving you the password for the log in.
[00:44:31 -> 00:44:33]  You just log in and check all this stuff.
[00:44:33 -> 00:44:35]  Then you will understand, yes, you are talking to the right department.
[00:44:35 -> 00:44:37]  Not a single PIN has gone out.
[00:44:37 -> 00:44:40]  Even I have given you a system with a new PIN also.
[00:44:40 -> 00:44:43]  This PIN is going to be blocked.
[00:44:43 -> 00:44:50]  I actually need to cease this conversation because I have no power left in this phone.
[00:44:50 -> 00:44:52]  I have been on the phone.
[00:44:52 -> 00:44:56]  Thank you for your support at this point.
[00:44:56 -> 00:45:02]  If you don't want to give the PIN for the card, do one thing.
```
