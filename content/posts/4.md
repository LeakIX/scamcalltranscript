[00:00:00 -> 00:00:01]  Hello.
[00:00:01 -> 00:00:02]  Hello.

[00:00:03 -> 00:00:08]  This is Hazel with your old age benefits.
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:11]  How are you doing today?
[00:00:11 -> 00:00:15]  I'm doing good.
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:20]  I'm calling because the updated plan for Medicare has just been released and it may give you
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:24]  some better access to things like dental, vision, hearing, and over the counter benefits.
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:29]  Now I believe you do have Medicare Part A and B, correct?
[00:00:29 -> 00:00:30]  Correct.
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:34]  Okay.
[00:00:34 -> 00:00:38]  This is all the information that I need for my side to check your eligibility, and it
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:39]  does look like you qualify.
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:44]  I'm going to go get a licensed agent to get you some more detail.
[00:00:44 -> 00:00:46]  Hi.

[00:00:48 -> 00:00:49]  How are you doing today?
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:50]  I'm doing good.
[00:00:50 -> 00:00:51]  All right.
[00:00:51 -> 00:00:52]  Good to hear that, sir.
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:59]  This call is all about your Medicare benefits and savings.
[00:00:59 -> 00:01:00]  You may qualify.
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:03]  Do you have Medicare Parts A and B?
[00:01:03 -> 00:01:04]  Yes.
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:05]  Okay.
[00:01:05 -> 00:01:06]  That's very good.
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:07]  How old are you?
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:08]  What's your age?
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:09]  I'm **redacted**.
[00:01:09 -> 00:01:10]  Okay.
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:11]  And God forbid, sir.
[00:01:11 -> 00:01:12]  Are you any kind of disability?
[00:01:12 -> 00:01:13]  Are you disabled?
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:14]  Yes.
[00:01:14 -> 00:01:15]  Sorry to hear that.
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:18]  And today, it's my pleasure to assist you, sir, as we are in special enrollment period
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:23]  that allows you to get those additional benefits that you are entitled for, like the
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:29]  food, groceries, utilities, and the best thing is that you might be qualified to get cash
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:32]  back on your social every month.
[00:01:32 -> 00:01:35]  How does that sound to you?
[00:01:35 -> 00:01:36]  That sounds great.
[00:01:36 -> 00:01:37]  Okay.
[00:01:37 -> 00:01:42]  So let me see here if I can help you with that to get you all those updated benefits,
[00:01:42 -> 00:01:43]  sir.
[00:01:43 -> 00:01:50]  Before we get started, I'd like to ask you a question.
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:54]  Let me see here if I can help you with that to get you all those updated benefits, sir.
[00:01:54 -> 00:01:58]  Before we get into this, I just wanted to confirm your five-page zip code.
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:04]  What's your zip code?
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:07]  **redacted**.
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:10]  And you're residing in the state of **redacted**, right?
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:13]  Yes.
[00:02:13 -> 00:02:14]  All right.
[00:02:14 -> 00:02:20]  Whenever you visit your family doctor or any kind of specialist, do you pay any copays over
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:23]  there, any kind of extra charges out of your pocket, sir?
[00:02:23 -> 00:02:29]  No, not an hour.
[00:02:29 -> 00:02:31]  Okay, that's very good.
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:32]  And what about Medicaid?
[00:02:32 -> 00:02:36]  I do believe you've got Medicaid and Medicare, right?
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:38]  Yes.
[00:02:38 -> 00:02:46]  Are you getting any kind of help for over-the-counter food, groceries, utilities every month, sir?
[00:02:46 -> 00:02:48]  Yes.
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:49]  All right, that's good.
[00:02:49 -> 00:02:50]  How much are you getting?
[00:02:50 -> 00:02:55]  Like you're getting $100, $150, $120?
[00:02:55 -> 00:02:56]  Uh-huh.
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:01]  $180, okay?
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:02]  That's very good.
[00:03:02 -> 00:03:05]  So that is the main reason I'm on the call with you.
[00:03:05 -> 00:03:09]  Medicare just recently released their updated plan in your area,
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:16]  and you might be qualified to get up to $305 for over-the-counter food, groceries.
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:19]  There must be a flex card manufacturer.
[00:03:19 -> 00:03:22]  Flex card is just like a debit card.
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:27]  You can use this card for Wellgreen, Walmart, grocery stores, hospitals,
[00:03:27 -> 00:03:31]  and you have coverage on that card up to $305.
[00:03:31 -> 00:03:33]  Would that be helpful for you?
[00:03:33 -> 00:03:35]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:35 -> 00:03:37]  That would be very helpful.
[00:03:37 -> 00:03:38]  Okay.
[00:03:38 -> 00:03:40]  Let's see here if I can help you with that, sir.
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:45]  And do you have someone help you out to make your health care decision,
[00:03:45 -> 00:03:49]  like a power of attorney, or you make your own decision?
[00:03:49 -> 00:03:54]  Oh, I make my own decisions for the most better half.
[00:03:54 -> 00:03:57]  But I have one question.
[00:03:57 -> 00:03:59]  Sure.
[00:03:59 -> 00:04:09]  Is that toward, can I pay it toward utility bills?
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:10]  Definitely, sir.

[00:04:14 -> 00:04:17]  your water bills, your gas bills, as well.
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:21]  All right. Awesome. I like this one.
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:22]  Yes.

[00:04:55 -> 00:04:56]  No.

[00:07:07 -> 00:07:15]  It's a hospital and a medical part A and B.
[00:07:15 -> 00:07:19]  There is some date mentioned on it when your COVID started.
[00:07:19 -> 00:07:22]  Can you read that date for me?
[00:07:22 -> 00:07:27]  I'll just read you the whole card.
[00:07:27 -> 00:07:31]  It says Medicare health insurance.
[00:07:31 -> 00:07:35]  And then it says name, choice, G for now.

[00:07:40 -> 00:07:41]  Okay.
[00:07:41 -> 00:07:42]  And the bottom.
[00:07:42 -> 00:07:44]  Sir, I don't need the number.
[00:07:44 -> 00:07:45]  I'm talking about the date.
[00:07:45 -> 00:07:48]  That must be mentioned, the lower bottom of your card.

[00:09:13 -> 00:09:18]  Once I connect your call, first there might be an operator first to the license agent.
[00:09:18 -> 00:09:22]  You should just verify your first name, your last name, and your date of birth
[00:09:22 -> 00:09:26]  just to make sure that we both are on the same page, okay?
[00:09:26 -> 00:09:31]  And after that, they will connect your call to the license agent in the state of Arkansas.
[00:09:31 -> 00:09:32]  Do you remember?
[00:09:32 -> 00:09:36]  Once the person joins the line and asks you how can I help you, sir,

[00:09:39 -> 00:09:43]  I would like to increase my over-the-counter food and groceries benefits,
[00:09:43 -> 00:09:47]  and I need flat side benefits, okay?

[00:10:26 -> 00:10:32]  and they're going to check if you are eligible with any additional benefits on your Medicare insurance plan.

[00:10:40 -> 00:10:41]  Yes.
[00:10:41 -> 00:10:45]  All right.

[00:13:50 -> 00:13:54]  We actually represent over 20 of the most trusted carriers in the nation.
[00:13:54 -> 00:14:00]  So I'm able to shop and compare and give you an unbiased opinion on who's offering you what with these benefits.
[00:14:00 -> 00:14:10]  But your UnitedHealthcare plan, do they currently provide you with the over-the-counter benefit, the grocery card, utility benefit, anything like that at this time?
[00:14:10 -> 00:14:16]  Yeah, but only $180 worth.
[00:14:16 -> 00:14:22]  Oh, gotcha. Okay. Yeah, so we can definitely take a look to see if we can help increase that benefit there for you.
[00:14:22 -> 00:14:24]  That's what I'll be looking to do.
[00:14:24 -> 00:14:33]  And then, I know it sounds like you have a dual plan. You have Medicare and Medicaid. So I know those come with dental, vision, and hearing benefits as well.
[00:14:33 -> 00:14:40]  But did you have any dental goals coming up this year that we can make sure you would have enough dental coverage for?
[00:14:40 -> 00:14:52]  No, not really, but I was wanting to go to the dentist and everything.
[00:14:52 -> 00:14:53]  Okay.
[00:14:53 -> 00:14:55]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:55 -> 00:15:05]  Gotcha. All right. Yeah, for sure. So we'll make sure that you have comprehensive coverage there to avoid having to pay out of pocket as much as possible whenever you're ready to use your dental.
[00:15:05 -> 00:15:11]  And then, do you pay anything out of pocket for your prescriptions at this time? See if we can help you save some money there.
[00:15:11 -> 00:15:20]  Not too much. Maybe a dollar, maybe at most.
[00:15:20 -> 00:15:21]  Okay.
[00:15:21 -> 00:15:22]  Gotcha.
[00:15:22 -> 00:15:23]  Other than that, I think it's zero.
[00:15:23 -> 00:15:25]  All right.
[00:15:25 -> 00:15:27]  Yeah.
[00:15:27 -> 00:15:33]  Et cetera. Oh, awesome. Okay. So, very good. This is good information here for me to start with.
[00:15:33 -> 00:15:43]  So, now with some information from your Medicare card, we'll be able to see exactly what you qualify for that provides, you know, more of that grocery utility benefit, things like that I'll be looking for.
[00:15:43 -> 00:15:48]  So, what is that series of letters and numbers on your red, white, and blue card?
[00:15:48 -> 00:16:13]  It is **redacted**-**redacted**-**redacted**.
[00:16:13 -> 00:16:20]  Okay, thank you for confirming that there for me.
[00:16:20 -> 00:16:27]  And then, let's see, date of birth, **redacted**, is that correct there?
[00:16:27 -> 00:16:35]  Yes, **redacted**.
[00:16:35 -> 00:16:41]  Very good, thank you for confirming that for me.
[00:16:41 -> 00:16:45]  And then before I can actually see a little bit more information here on your coverage,
[00:16:45 -> 00:16:48]  what benefits you may be eligible for, things like that,
[00:16:48 -> 00:16:51]  I will be playing a recording for compliance purposes.
[00:16:51 -> 00:16:56]  At the end, please say yes or no.
[00:16:56 -> 00:16:59]  Before we discuss your plan options, and with your permission,
[00:16:59 -> 00:17:01]  I would like to check your eligibility status.
[00:17:01 -> 00:17:05]  Your status will help us determine what plans you may be eligible to enroll into.
[00:17:05 -> 00:17:10]  Please note that the status is based on current information available and is not guaranteed.
[00:17:10 -> 00:17:14]  CMS will make the final determination of eligibility if an application is submitted.
[00:17:14 -> 00:17:18]  Do I have your consent to check your eligibility status?
[00:17:18 -> 00:17:19]  Yes.
[00:17:19 -> 00:17:24]  Okay, thank you for that.
[00:17:24 -> 00:17:27]  So I'll let that information load up here for us now,
[00:17:27 -> 00:17:31]  and I should be able to see a little bit more here shortly, so this will be good.
[00:17:31 -> 00:17:39]  Awesome, okay, so I see your Part A and B started January 1st, 2004,
[00:17:39 -> 00:17:46]  and then take a look here to see if we can gather more benefits here in your county.
[00:17:46 -> 00:17:48]  Are you in **redacted**?
[00:17:48 -> 00:17:49]  Yes.
[00:17:49 -> 00:17:51]  It puts **redacted**.
[00:17:51 -> 00:17:52]  Okay, awesome.
[00:17:52 -> 00:17:54]  Yeah, **redacted**.
[00:17:54 -> 00:17:56]  Take a look there.
[00:17:56 -> 00:17:59]  Before I do take a closer look though, I have to ask,
[00:17:59 -> 00:18:04]  do you have someone who usually helps you make your healthcare decisions like a power of attorney?
[00:18:04 -> 00:18:05]  No.
[00:18:05 -> 00:18:09]  Okay, very good.
[00:18:09 -> 00:18:11]  So we can continue here then.
[00:18:11 -> 00:18:15]  And let's see, we'll take a look at these benefits in a little bit more detail,
[00:18:15 -> 00:18:18]  but I do have to get your permission to do that first.
[00:18:18 -> 00:18:24]  So do I have your permission to discuss Medicare Advantage plans and prescription drug plans?
[00:18:24 -> 00:18:27]  Yes.
[00:18:27 -> 00:18:29]  Okay, thank you for that.
[00:18:29 -> 00:18:33]  And then just so you're aware, you're not required to provide any health information.
[00:18:33 -> 00:18:35]  There is no obligation to enroll.
[00:18:35 -> 00:18:39]  Current or future Medicare enrollment status will not be impacted,
[00:18:39 -> 00:18:43]  and automatic enrollment will not occur.
[00:18:43 -> 00:18:45]  So that is good to know there.
[00:18:45 -> 00:18:57]  Looking at plan options here so far, just want to get an idea of what's available here.
[00:18:57 -> 00:19:03]  I do see some doctors that we've listed here.
[00:19:03 -> 00:19:06]  I don't know if these are still accurate, but I'll confirm here.
[00:19:06 -> 00:19:11]  It looks like **redacted**, **redacted**?
[00:19:12 -> 00:19:15]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:15 -> 00:19:20]  I ain't familiar with all the doctors either.
[00:19:20 -> 00:19:23]  Oh, okay.
[00:19:23 -> 00:19:28]  I have to look at a pill bottle and then a beer bottle.
[00:19:28 -> 00:19:34]  I see. Okay, that's all right.
[00:19:34 -> 00:19:35]  Okay.
[00:19:35 -> 00:19:44]  I want it to confirm for me there, but basically what I would be doing here, you know, with looking at any benefits, we like to make sure that doctors can stay in the network for you.
[00:19:44 -> 00:19:50]  So if I do find more benefits, that's what I'll be looking, you know, making sure doctors are in network as much as possible.
[00:19:50 -> 00:19:58]  If you are able to gather your prescriptions and your doctors, that would be great.
[00:19:58 -> 00:20:18]  Well, I got one prescription right here, and then the other one comes through the mail.
[00:20:18 -> 00:20:20]  Oh, you do the mail order pharmacy?
[00:20:20 -> 00:20:28]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I order through the mail. Hold on, let me get them on my vocals.
[00:20:28 -> 00:20:31]  Or take them off to where I can read them.
[00:20:31 -> 00:20:32]  Okay, that's alright.
[00:20:32 -> 00:20:43]  It's **redacted**.
[00:20:43 -> 00:20:50]  Gotcha. You said that's the mail order pharmacy that you use?
[00:20:50 -> 00:21:19]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's **redacted**. **redacted**, **redacted** **redacted**. Yeah, yeah, that's my mail order pharmacy.
[00:21:19 -> 00:21:24]  Yeah, yeah, that's my address. My P.O. Box.
[00:21:24 -> 00:21:30]  Okay. Oh, gotcha. That's where they mail everything to you. Okay.
[00:21:30 -> 00:21:31]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:31 -> 00:21:32]  Right.
[00:21:32 -> 00:21:33]  Kind of.
[00:21:33 -> 00:21:36]  Okay. That's good information there.
[00:21:36 -> 00:21:37]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:37 -> 00:21:47]  All right. So, let me see. I'm going to try to confirm your Medicaid level here as well. That usually determines what benefits you're eligible for, and then we'll kind of go from there.
[00:21:47 -> 00:22:02]  Now, did you, I know you said you didn't, you were, I don't know if you had any big goals for dental, but you just wanted to make sure you might, I think you said you'd take care of it there, but nothing specific.
[00:22:02 -> 00:22:03]  Yeah.
[00:22:03 -> 00:22:04]  Okay.
[00:22:04 -> 00:22:09]  Just to have coverage for your case.
[00:22:09 -> 00:22:10]  Yeah.
[00:22:10 -> 00:22:16]  Oh, yes sir. Okay.
[00:22:16 -> 00:22:25]  So yeah, we can definitely take a look here at your options there. Were you able to find your doctors at all? Any of their names or?
[00:22:25 -> 00:22:58]  Um, I have one doctor, and it's **redacted**, **redacted**, and then it says **redacted**, whatever that is.
[00:22:58 -> 00:23:04]  And you said, what was that doctor's name again? I'm sorry. I heard it correctly.
[00:23:04 -> 00:23:18]  **redacted**, **redacted**L-L.
[00:23:18 -> 00:23:43]  Oh, okay. Beautiful. All right. Okay.
[00:23:43 -> 00:23:50]  Then are there any other doctors at this time that are important to keep? Specialist or?
[00:23:50 -> 00:24:24]  Well, there's the other bottles, but then there's the **redacted**, I guess.
[00:24:24 -> 00:24:30]  Okay. That's one of the doctors, Dr. **redacted**?
[00:24:30 -> 00:24:38]  Yeah, yeah, or something to that effect because they...
[00:24:38 -> 00:24:41]  Okay. And you said the first name? Did you say **redacted**?
[00:24:41 -> 00:24:50]  No, it is **redacted**, whatever that stands for. And then...
[00:24:50 -> 00:24:52]  Oh, okay.
[00:24:52 -> 00:25:13]  **redacted**, and the other one says **redacted** or something, and this one says **redacted**, **redacted**.
[00:25:13 -> 00:25:15]  **redacted**, okay.
[00:25:15 -> 00:25:31]  Yeah, yeah. And, oh, and **redacted**.
[00:25:31 -> 00:25:41]  That's another doctor's name? You said?
[00:25:41 -> 00:25:42]  Yeah.
[00:25:42 -> 00:25:43]  **redacted**
[00:25:43 -> 00:25:54]  Or an **redacted** or **redacted**. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. And...
[00:25:54 -> 00:25:59]  Are these doctors that you've seen before, or are they just kind of prescribing the medicine?
[00:25:59 -> 00:26:19]  They prescribe the medicine, and that one doctor, **redacted**, I just seen it at the **redacted** Clinic in **redacted**.
[00:26:36 -> 00:26:57]  Well, I can give you the number to the **redacted** Clinic in **redacted**, and it's **redacted**.
[00:26:57 -> 00:26:59]  Are those doctors there?
[00:26:59 -> 00:27:15]  Yes, doctors and nurses and all of my therapists and all of the docs are located there and it's **redacted**.
[00:27:15 -> 00:27:55]  Okay, that's awesome. So, let me see. Pull up there. **redacted** rural health center. If I can see so far, specialty doctors I see.
[00:27:56 -> 00:28:25]  Hi, Dr. **redacted**. **redacted**. There was maybe some of the names that you were spelling out to me there. That's what I'm looking for.
[00:28:28 -> 00:28:50]  Down to **redacted**. Other names. They're not really matching up to the names you've given me so far, so I'm not too sure.
[00:28:50 -> 00:29:24]  Well, whoever ordered the script for the bagged cholesterol, that was the Pravastatin sodium tab, 40 milligrams.
[00:29:32 -> 00:29:50]  Is that just one time per day?
[00:29:50 -> 00:30:01]  Yes.
[00:30:01 -> 00:30:06]  Is there a doctor's name on that one?
[00:30:06 -> 00:30:10]  Yeah, on that one.
[00:30:10 -> 00:30:21]  Well, this was, again, **redacted** Pharmacy sent him to me.
[00:30:21 -> 00:30:24]  Okay, gotcha.
[00:30:24 -> 00:30:36]  Dr. **redacted**, I found it. It says Dr. **redacted**.
[00:30:36 -> 00:30:41]  Yeah, **redacted**, and then **redacted**.
[00:30:41 -> 00:30:56]  Okay, **redacted**'s listed here as well. At least we have an idea where some of your doctors are in the networks that are prescribing.
[00:30:56 -> 00:31:13]  There she looks to be good, **redacted**. Pretty good.
[00:31:13 -> 00:31:21]  And then, are there any other doctors that you think of or that you see?
[00:31:21 -> 00:31:26]  I see some other doctors listed here. Let me see.
[00:31:26 -> 00:31:36]  I see a **redacted**, that sounds familiar.
[00:31:36 -> 00:31:38]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:38 -> 00:31:44]  Okay. And then I also see a **redacted**.
[00:31:44 -> 00:31:56]  Yeah, yeah, **redacted**. I think he retired or quit. I'm not sure.
[00:31:56 -> 00:32:12]  Okay. And I guess it's about four or five doctors listed now, so I don't know if you can think of any others that you might see.
[00:32:12 -> 00:32:19]  But I'll start. I can start looking at these benefits with these doctors so far just to give us an idea.
[00:32:19 -> 00:32:29]  But, you know, benefits are available to you. I could see different carriers, of course, so I would be, you know, comparing and seeing what they're offering you here with these benefits.
[00:32:29 -> 00:32:37]  I do see, so the carriers they usually offer benefits in different, you know, benefit structures, I guess we could say.
[00:32:37 -> 00:32:45]  So it looks like, you know, **redacted**, I see **redacted** offering more dental than the plan we have now.
[00:32:45 -> 00:32:57]  They offer things like, or let's see, there are special supplemental benefits for the chronically ill, worry-free meals.
[00:32:57 -> 00:33:05]  They offer things like that. If you're diagnosed with, you know, COPD, diabetes, congestive heart failure,
[00:33:05 -> 00:33:14]  and you participate with a care management service and you meet program criteria, you may receive two meals per day for 12 weeks.
[00:33:14 -> 00:33:21]  And you can actually use that up to two times per plan here. So that's another benefit that **redacted** offers as well.
[00:33:22 -> 00:33:32]  Post-discharge, personal home care, and maybe in-home support services following a discharge from a skilled nursing facility or from an in-patient hospitalization.
[00:33:32 -> 00:33:40]  Someone could come in, you know, and help out with certain things around the house, maybe running errands for you, things like that.
[00:33:40 -> 00:33:48]  They also offer something here called the Humana Flexible Care Assistance.
[00:33:48 -> 00:34:02]  And eligible members may receive medical expense assistance and other additional benefits, either primarily health-related or non-health-related, of course, but to address the member's unique individual's needs.
[00:34:02 -> 00:34:06]  So benefits are limited up to $1,000 per year for that.
[00:34:06 -> 00:34:16]  And this **redacted** Flexible Care Assistance, you know, in order to take advantage of it, you must be coordinated and authorized by a care manager.
[00:34:16 -> 00:34:26]  So that's something there if you're participating in a care management service and meet program criteria for that with a chronic health condition.
[00:34:26 -> 00:34:34]  So, you know, some of these carriers, they offer benefits here that, you know, we may find helpful, you know, one time or another there.
[00:34:34 -> 00:34:44]  They also provide the **redacted** Healthy Options Allowance, which is $150 every month on a prepaid card that they use towards, you know, food.
[00:34:44 -> 00:34:56]  You can use it towards over-the-counter. You can pay a bill with it, rent, non-medical transportation, home supplies, pest control, pet care and supplies.
[00:34:56 -> 00:35:04]  So they basically give you a long list of things that you can use to, you know, purchase with that $150 every month there.
[00:35:04 -> 00:35:09]  Any unused funds will roll over to the next month and expire at the end of the plan year.
[00:35:09 -> 00:35:17]  So that's another perk that a lot of people like with **redacted** as well, is that that money will roll over to the next month.
[00:35:17 -> 00:35:32]  I currently am getting $180 toward utilities and Walmart products and groceries.
[00:35:32 -> 00:35:36]  Yeah, for sure. I understand. There's a ton of $30 difference there.
[00:35:36 -> 00:35:40]  I think what **redacted**'s...oh, yes sir.
[00:35:40 -> 00:35:46]  Yeah, and it's toward my phone bill too as well.
[00:35:46 -> 00:35:54]  Or if I...for **redacted** or something. I don't know.
[00:35:54 -> 00:36:02]  Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, it looks like you may give more dental.
[00:36:02 -> 00:36:10]  No, I can get up to $300 benefits somehow.
[00:36:10 -> 00:36:15]  I was looking there to see if there were any carriers that were offering a bit more of that.
[00:36:15 -> 00:36:19]  I didn't find it with UnitedHealthcare.
[00:36:19 -> 00:36:22]  I can see WellCare plans here.
[00:36:22 -> 00:36:26]  I don't know if they were suggesting a grocery allowance.
[00:36:26 -> 00:36:32]  Some people, depending on your zip code, is how they usually shop or how those benefits usually come about.
[00:36:32 -> 00:36:37]  So your zip code, you know, the carrier, who's offering those benefits there.
[00:36:37 -> 00:36:44]  So it looks like here for the most part, you know, the other carriers, I do see that they offer more benefits in other areas,
[00:36:44 -> 00:36:48]  like more dental, the flux card for dental vision and hearing.
[00:36:48 -> 00:36:56]  You know, so there is potential of increasing your benefits in areas, you know, that could be important to you at one time or another.
[00:36:56 -> 00:37:03]  But looking at the grocery allowance, I mean, the 180 is the most I can see here so far.
[00:37:03 -> 00:37:09]  So we just look at, you know, the plan options here as a whole, at least so you know what's available to you.
[00:37:10 -> 00:37:19]  So if you ever felt like you needed to make any adjustments or changes here, we can always take a look with you again, you know, if that was ever needed.
[00:37:21 -> 00:37:31]  Yeah, I mean, in this case, though, we know, you know, Humana does offer a different type of benefit structure, like that, you know, that 150, it rolls over.
[00:37:31 -> 00:37:35]  You can use it towards home supplies, pet care and supplies, things like that.
[00:37:35 -> 00:37:39]  So there are some people who look at Humana because of those reasons there.
[00:37:39 -> 00:37:44]  They also offer more dental on their plan, $4,000 in dental.
[00:37:44 -> 00:37:56]  And so basically, that's how I would have narrowed it down here is, you know, to see who would be offering you, you know, the most of whatever you may need at that particular time.
[00:37:56 -> 00:38:00]  So that's how we kind of shop for those benefits that way.
[00:38:00 -> 00:38:07]  But just what I've shared with you so far, I mean, what do you feel about the benefits that I've shared with you on that **redacted** plan?
[00:38:07 -> 00:38:16]  Yeah, yeah, they're all right, but I'm not going to change my insurance.
[00:38:16 -> 00:38:26]  For sure. I understand. Yeah, I imagine if we could find more of that grocery allowance, it would have been a no-brainer, I'm sure.
[00:38:27 -> 00:38:33]  Are we through here? Are we through here?
[00:38:33 -> 00:38:44]  Pretty much, I would say so. Yeah, I was going to say we can connect you to any other resources and services that may be available to you with your UnitedHealthcare account.
[00:38:44 -> 00:38:55]  There we have a membership called Population Health that they connect you with a benefit coordinator who might be able to connect you to more of those resources and services available.
[00:38:55 -> 00:38:58]  Does that sound like a good plan, Mr. **redacted**? Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:58 -> 00:39:08]  Okay, all right. So we won't make any changes to your plan at this time. We can at least try to help you maximize what is being offered to you here.
[00:39:08 -> 00:39:16]  So it looks like here, one of the questions that they will ask me is do you take six or more medications that are prescribed by a health care professional?
[00:39:16 -> 00:39:21]  Do you take six or more at this time? Yes.
[00:39:21 -> 00:39:31]  Yes, sir. And are at least six of your prescribed medications being filled on a 30- to 90-day basis? Yes.
[00:39:31 -> 00:39:47]  Okay. So yeah, you do qualify for this exciting service that's at no charge to you. Population Health, what they'll do is they'll take a look and see what else UnitedHealthcare may be offering you that we can get you connected with without making any changes to your plan.
[00:39:47 -> 00:39:52]  So I'll get them here to explain a little bit more about how we can help out there.
[00:39:52 -> 00:40:02]  Excellent.
[00:40:02 -> 00:40:12]  I'll give them a minute or so here. We usually don't take too long, so I'll let them know what man you do need.
[00:40:12 -> 00:40:16]  Thank you for contacting Population Health. This is Justin on the recorded line.
[00:40:16 -> 00:40:23]  Hi Justin. I do have Mr. **redacted** on the line with us today, and he currently has a UnitedHealthcare dual plan.
[00:40:23 -> 00:40:33]  That plan ID number is **redacted**, and if we can help connect him to any resources and services available, please.
[00:40:33 -> 00:40:36]  Of course, ma'am. We'll get them all taken care of.
[00:40:36 -> 00:40:38]  Thank you. I appreciate your help.
[00:40:38 -> 00:40:43]  Hi, Mr. **redacted**. This is Justin with Population Health on the recorded line. How are you doing this afternoon?
[00:40:43 -> 00:40:47]  I'm doing good.
[00:40:47 -> 00:40:52]  How are your benefits coordinated today, sir? We're going to finish up your call here with your Population Health membership and benefits.
[00:40:52 -> 00:40:56]  This is a no-cost service provided to you by a select quote.
[00:40:56 -> 00:41:03]  My job today is to find you those services you qualify for and are entitled to with your current UnitedHealthcare coverage.
[00:41:03 -> 00:41:08]  I do not change the benefits you are receiving through your plan or your plan itself.
[00:41:08 -> 00:41:14]  So again, this is a no-cost service. It is not part of your Medicare Advantage plan.
[00:41:14 -> 00:41:18]  You are not obligated to take action on the recommendations that we make here.
[00:41:18 -> 00:41:22]  Do I have your permission to continue to discuss Population Health services?
[00:41:22 -> 00:41:26]  Yes.
[00:41:26 -> 00:41:30]  Now, while I know you just reviewed your plan with your agent, we're not going to go through all that again.
[00:41:30 -> 00:41:37]  Do you have any questions before we move along to benefits? Good deal.
[00:41:37 -> 00:41:43]  Just know a customer care agent would be reaching out to you in the next two business days just to make sure everybody treated you professionally.
[00:41:43 -> 00:41:45]  Of course, you didn't have any further questions at that time.
[00:41:45 -> 00:41:54]  Now, before we move along, if I can talk today, before we move along, I do have a short recording I have to play for you for compliance purposes.
[00:41:54 -> 00:41:58]  At the end here, just give me a good yes or no and get Rockman rolling on your benefits.
[00:41:58 -> 00:42:01]  I'll play that for you now.
[00:42:01 -> 00:42:09]  I am needing your verbal agreement that you are opting in to Population Health membership and you agree to transferring your select quote data to Population Health
[00:42:09 -> 00:42:13]  so that we can save some time today in setting up your health profile.
[00:42:13 -> 00:42:21]  Population Health will help provide education and coordination of the managed care services available to you through your carrier or the general marketplace.
[00:42:21 -> 00:42:25]  Your membership is governed by the Population Health customer agreement.
[00:42:25 -> 00:42:33]  We will email you a more in-depth services agreement or you can find it online at www.populationhealth.com.
[00:42:33 -> 00:42:41]  If you need to cancel, you can call us at **redacted**.
[00:42:41 -> 00:42:45]  We need your consent to contact you at the number you are calling from.
[00:42:45 -> 00:42:50]  Your permission includes our use of an automated telephone dialing system to initiate our calls.
[00:42:50 -> 00:42:55]  Do you agree to these terms? Please say yes or no.
[00:42:55 -> 00:42:59]  Yes.
[00:42:59 -> 00:43:04]  It's there. And the first thing we've got to do here is dot our I's and cross our T's.
[00:43:04 -> 00:43:07]  Make sure we've got all the information correct on the screen for you.
[00:43:07 -> 00:43:12]  At this point it all should be correct, but if you need anything out of place just dot me and we'll make sure to make those corrections.
[00:43:12 -> 00:43:23]  We've got **redacted**, middle initial G, last name **redacted**-L, birthday **redacted**.
[00:43:23 -> 00:43:27]  Do you have an email address you want to put in here today boss or would you like to put print only?
[00:43:27 -> 00:43:41]  No, email at the moment.
[00:43:41 -> 00:43:51]  Okay, so put print only at noemail.com.
[00:43:52 -> 00:43:56]  I put the ad symbol instead of the two, there we go.
[00:43:56 -> 00:44:00]  And then preferred language English, physical address.
[00:44:00 -> 00:44:07]  We've got **redacted**, box **redacted**.
[00:44:07 -> 00:44:14]  That's **redacted**, **redacted**, **redacted**, and **redacted** County.
[00:44:14 -> 00:44:18]  Telephone number **redacted**, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:44:18 -> 00:44:24]  That's an old address, and it's not in **redacted**, it's in **redacted**.
[00:44:24 -> 00:44:41]  And it's **redacted** box **redacted**, **redacted**, **redacted**.
[00:44:41 -> 00:44:43]  Is the zip code different?
[00:44:43 -> 00:44:57]  **redacted** should be **redacted**.
[00:44:57 -> 00:45:00]  Okay, see it is. It goes upright.
[00:45:00 -> 00:45:06]  And then telephone number **redacted**, correct?
[00:45:06 -> 00:45:10]  Yes, correct.
[00:45:10 -> 00:45:16]  Same. Red, white, and blue is in there. Dates are in there.
[00:45:16 -> 00:45:21]  Medicare and your plan.
[00:45:21 -> 00:45:33]  Computer. Healthcare. **redacted**.
[00:45:33 -> 00:45:37]  And on your Medicare, that's parts A and B, correct?
[00:45:37 -> 00:45:40]  Yes.
[00:45:40 -> 00:45:43]  Okay, good day.
[00:45:43 -> 00:45:48]  Alright, so the best way to make sure we get you everything you're entitled to is to complete what we call a health risk assessment.
[00:45:48 -> 00:45:51]  You can assign yes or no questions to determine eligibility.
[00:45:51 -> 00:45:55]  If you currently take six or more prescription drugs, yes or no?
[00:45:55 -> 00:45:58]  Yes.
[00:45:58 -> 00:46:02]  If yes, how many total?
[00:46:02 -> 00:46:06]  I don't know. I'm on the bathroom right now.
[00:46:06 -> 00:46:15]  I have gotten. I'm sorry.
[00:46:15 -> 00:46:16]  What? What?
[00:46:16 -> 00:46:17]  Sir?
