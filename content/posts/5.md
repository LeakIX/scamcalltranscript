```
[00:00:00 -> 00:00:07]  Thank you for calling support, you're speaking with Spencer, how can I help you?
[00:00:07 -> 00:00:20]  Well, Spencer, my computer started giving me alarms, says that it is being taken over by somebody that it doesn't know.
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:26]  Okay, don't worry.
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:31]  Okay, don't worry, we're surely going to help you out.
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:36]  So what exactly are you trying to do when you got the problem here?
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:40]  Yes, I'm here looking at it.
[00:00:40 -> 00:00:43]  Okay.
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:49]  Is it a work computer or a personal computer that you have, miss?
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:53]  It's my computer.
[00:00:53 -> 00:00:56]  Okay, it's a personal computer, right?
[00:00:56 -> 00:00:57]  Yes.
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:01]  Okay, can you please turn the volume down now so that I can hear you properly?
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:07]  I can't. There's no way that I can get to it. I can't.
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:11]  Okay, no problem. I can help you with that, okay?
[00:01:11 -> 00:01:14]  Look on the right-hand side of your screen on the lower bottom.
[00:01:14 -> 00:01:18]  Do you see there is a time and date option there?
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:21]  No.
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:25]  Okay, then look on the left-hand side of your keyboard on the lower left-hand side.
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:30]  There would be a control key, CTRL key there. Do you see that control key?
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:32]  Yes.
[00:01:32 -> 00:01:37]  Right next to the control key, which key do you have?
[00:01:37 -> 00:01:41]  It's FN.
[00:01:41 -> 00:01:45]  And right next to FN there is a window key, right, with the four flags on it?
[00:01:45 -> 00:01:47]  Yes.
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:52]  So you need to press that window key and the letter R at the same time, okay?
[00:01:55 -> 00:01:58]  Nope, nothing.
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:03]  Just press the window once and let go.
[00:02:03 -> 00:02:05]  Now look on...
[00:02:05 -> 00:02:14]  Just press the window key once and then let it go, okay?
[00:02:14 -> 00:02:15]  Okay?
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:22]  Yep.
[00:02:22 -> 00:02:26]  You don't have anything on there either to say...
[00:02:26 -> 00:02:28]  Hang on.
[00:02:52 -> 00:03:02]  Okay, now what do I do with it?
[00:03:02 -> 00:03:07]  Now look on the screen on the right hand side, ma'am. There is a speaker option that will be there.
[00:03:07 -> 00:03:21]  I'll just try to turn it down.
[00:03:21 -> 00:03:23]  Okay, you did it, right?
[00:03:23 -> 00:03:34]  Well, it wasn't a speaker, it was a star that you had to turn off the thing on your computer.
[00:03:34 -> 00:03:38]  Okay, no problem, ma'am. We'll go ahead and check everything for you, okay?
[00:03:38 -> 00:03:40]  We'll see what happened right now.
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:43]  Accidentally, you might hit the wrong link, okay?
[00:03:43 -> 00:03:50]  Some sort of patch or some sort of advertisement, and that is the reason why you have a problem like this.
[00:03:50 -> 00:03:51]  No, not to worry.
[00:03:51 -> 00:03:54]  Is this going to cost me money?
[00:03:54 -> 00:04:01]  Well, you're directly calling Microsoft now, and there will be no charges to get it fixed, okay?
[00:04:01 -> 00:04:03]  I hope not, because I don't have anything.
[00:04:03 -> 00:04:05]  No problem, we'll go ahead and check everything.
[00:04:05 -> 00:04:07]  I am totally broke.
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:08]  Okay.
[00:04:08 -> 00:04:09]  Alrighty.
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:18]  So what is the basic purpose you use this computer for?
[00:04:18 -> 00:04:22]  I do bill paying.
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:26]  I do some Zoom with some friends.
[00:04:26 -> 00:04:30]  Check my email.
[00:04:30 -> 00:04:32]  Okay.
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:34]  Not a problem, ma'am.
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:38]  I'm going to give you some troubleshooting steps to go ahead and check all the problems
[00:04:38 -> 00:04:41]  so that I can help you with each and everything, okay?
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:44]  Because right now you're having kind of a security breach.
[00:04:44 -> 00:04:49]  It could be possible that the hackers have been trying to do all the things, okay?
[00:04:49 -> 00:04:52]  So that I'm going to go ahead and check.
[00:04:52 -> 00:04:53]  All right?
[00:04:53 -> 00:04:54]  All righty.
[00:04:54 -> 00:04:57]  All righty.
[00:04:57 -> 00:05:01]  Please help me with your first and last name.
[00:05:01 -> 00:05:04]  That's **redacted**.
[00:05:04 -> 00:05:06]  Hang on, I got somebody at the door.
[00:05:06 -> 00:05:08]  Hang on.
[00:05:08 -> 00:05:09]  Okay.
[00:05:09 -> 00:05:11]  Can I call you back?
[00:05:11 -> 00:05:12]  No, I can hold on, ma'am.
[00:05:12 -> 00:05:14]  No problem.
[00:05:14 -> 00:05:18]  Well, it might be a little bit.
[00:05:18 -> 00:05:20]  Well, this is a serious problem, ma'am.
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:24]  We have to get it done right now.
[00:05:24 -> 00:05:26]  All right, hang on.
[00:05:26 -> 00:07:20]  Are you still there?
[00:07:20 -> 00:07:22]  Yes, I am.
[00:07:22 -> 00:07:23]  Can you hear me?
[00:07:23 -> 00:07:24]  Thank you for holding.
[00:07:24 -> 00:07:26]  Yeah, thank you for holding.
[00:07:26 -> 00:07:32]  Not a problem.
[00:07:32 -> 00:07:35]  So are you free now?
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:36]  Yes.
[00:07:36 -> 00:07:37]  Okay, great.
[00:07:37 -> 00:07:40]  So what I'm going to do, ma'am, I'm just going to go ahead
[00:07:40 -> 00:07:43]  and give you some troubleshooting steps to go ahead
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:45]  and check all the things, and then I'll help you
[00:07:45 -> 00:07:47]  with everything, okay?
[00:07:47 -> 00:07:52]  It's going to take a little while, so you have to be patient, okay?
[00:07:52 -> 00:07:59]  Well, that's what people tell me I have most of.
[00:07:59 -> 00:08:02]  Sorry, beg your pardon?
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:05]  People tell me I have a lot of patience.
[00:08:05 -> 00:08:06]  Oh, great, great.
[00:08:06 -> 00:08:10]  Yeah, that's all we need right now.
[00:08:10 -> 00:08:13]  We're going to go ahead and check all the things, okay?
[00:08:13 -> 00:08:18]  So from how long you're using this computer?
[00:08:18 -> 00:08:21]  How long have I had it?
[00:08:21 -> 00:08:29]  I'd say about five years.
[00:08:29 -> 00:08:31]  And you had it for five years.
[00:08:31 -> 00:08:32]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[00:08:32 -> 00:08:40]  And you were getting this problem for the very first time, you said, right?
[00:08:40 -> 00:08:44]  Well, it has blocked.
[00:08:44 -> 00:08:47]  Sometimes it blocks, and I have to call.
[00:08:47 -> 00:08:53]  But this is the first time all these things have popped up.
[00:08:53 -> 00:08:58]  Like I've got one that says access to the computer is blocked for security reasons.
[00:08:58 -> 00:09:01]  It won't let me go back and do anything.
[00:09:01 -> 00:09:04]  These three things are stuck on my screen.
[00:09:04 -> 00:09:08]  I completely understand, ma'am.
[00:09:08 -> 00:09:12]  But see, right now what is happening, this is a case of a security breach.
[00:09:12 -> 00:09:17]  Accidentally, you allowed hackers to get into your computer.
[00:09:17 -> 00:09:20]  So what I'll do here, I'm just going to give you some troubleshooting steps
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:25]  so that we can go ahead and check all the problems like what we are having right now
[00:09:25 -> 00:09:28]  so that it will be easier to help you.
[00:09:28 -> 00:09:33]  So I'm going to give you some troubleshooting steps that you have to follow.
[00:09:33 -> 00:09:39]  Alrighty.
[00:09:39 -> 00:09:45]  Okay, great.
[00:09:45 -> 00:09:48]  Now have a look on your keyboard extreme left bottom corner.
[00:09:48 -> 00:09:52]  You have a control key, right? CTRL key?
[00:09:52 -> 00:09:53]  Yes.
[00:09:53 -> 00:10:00]  And right next to that, which key do you have?
[00:10:00 -> 00:10:01]  SM.
[00:10:01 -> 00:10:07]  Okay, and right next to that there will be a window key.
[00:10:07 -> 00:10:10]  You need to press the window and R at the same time, okay?
[00:10:10 -> 00:10:16]  Window and F. Oh, you said R.
[00:10:16 -> 00:10:18]  Yeah, window and R at the same time.
[00:10:18 -> 00:10:19]  Okay.
[00:10:19 -> 00:10:20]  Yep.
[00:10:20 -> 00:10:22]  Okay.
[00:10:22 -> 00:10:23]  What do you got?
[00:10:23 -> 00:10:27]  I got NETPLWIZ.
[00:10:27 -> 00:10:33]  Okay, make that box empty, okay?
[00:10:33 -> 00:10:34]  Erase that.
[00:10:34 -> 00:10:36]  Make it empty.
[00:10:36 -> 00:10:40]  Okay.
[00:10:40 -> 00:10:42]  Now what do you want me to put in there?
[00:10:42 -> 00:10:48]  Now type in there www dot.
[00:10:48 -> 00:10:49]  Okay.
[00:10:49 -> 00:10:50]  H is in Harry.
[00:10:50 -> 00:10:54]  O is in Oscar.
[00:10:54 -> 00:10:55]  H, O.
[00:10:55 -> 00:10:58]  P is in Paul.

[00:12:18 -> 00:12:25]  Now where do you want me to go?
[00:12:25 -> 00:12:27]  Now click on okay.
[00:12:27 -> 00:12:34]  Alrighty.
[00:12:34 -> 00:12:35]  Mm-hmm.
[00:12:35 -> 00:12:40]  Alrighty.
[00:12:40 -> 00:12:41]  This screen comes up.
[00:12:41 -> 00:12:42]  It's got a kangaroo on it.
[00:12:42 -> 00:12:44]  It's at another computer.
[00:12:44 -> 00:12:45]  Okay.
[00:12:45 -> 00:12:47]  Do you see the option of download now?
[00:12:47 -> 00:12:48]  Hit that.
[00:12:48 -> 00:12:49]  Yes.
[00:12:49 -> 00:12:52]  Mm-hmm.
[00:12:52 -> 00:12:57]  Do you want me to open it up?
[00:12:57 -> 00:12:58]  Yes.
[00:12:58 -> 00:13:04]  Okay.
[00:13:04 -> 00:13:09]  Do I put yes or no?
[00:13:09 -> 00:13:10]  Yeah, click on yes.
[00:13:10 -> 00:13:16]  Alrighty.
[00:13:16 -> 00:13:17]  Mm-hmm.
[00:13:17 -> 00:13:24]  The yes disappeared.
[00:13:24 -> 00:13:27]  Control remote desktop.
[00:13:27 -> 00:13:30]  Now there's an option of install.
[00:13:30 -> 00:13:31]  Okay.
[00:13:31 -> 00:13:36]  So just hit install.
[00:13:36 -> 00:13:38]  Hit what?
[00:13:38 -> 00:13:39]  Hit install.
[00:13:39 -> 00:13:48]  I don't have that on here.
[00:13:48 -> 00:13:56]  Do you see there's ID number, ma'am, and the password, and if you see down a little bit, there's an option of install.
[00:13:56 -> 00:13:57]  Okay.
[00:13:57 -> 00:13:58]  So you need to click on install.
[00:13:58 -> 00:13:59]  Okay.
[00:13:59 -> 00:14:00]  Okay.
[00:14:00 -> 00:14:01]  Yeah.
[00:14:01 -> 00:14:03]  Underneath the kangaroo.
[00:14:03 -> 00:14:08]  Uh-huh.
[00:14:08 -> 00:14:09]  All right.
[00:14:09 -> 00:14:11]  Accept and install.
[00:14:11 -> 00:14:12]  Yeah.
[00:14:12 -> 00:14:13]  Accept and install, yeah.
[00:14:13 -> 00:14:19]  All righty.
[00:14:19 -> 00:14:21]  Uh-huh.
[00:14:21 -> 00:14:22]  It came up.
[00:14:22 -> 00:14:25]  Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?
[00:14:25 -> 00:14:26]  Click on yes.
[00:14:26 -> 00:14:27]  Yes or no?
[00:14:27 -> 00:14:28]  Yeah.
[00:14:28 -> 00:14:29]  Click on yes.
[00:14:29 -> 00:14:30]  All righty.
[00:14:30 -> 00:14:45]  Now it went back to the kangaroo.
[00:14:45 -> 00:14:53]  The kangaroo, it says control remote desktop and...
[00:14:53 -> 00:14:54]  Now there's an ID number.
[00:14:54 -> 00:14:58]  You need to read that ID number to me now.
[00:14:58 -> 00:15:05]  **redacted**.
[00:15:05 -> 00:15:09]  Password?
[00:15:09 -> 00:15:13]  **redacted**.
[00:15:13 -> 00:15:18]  **redacted** after that?
[00:15:18 -> 00:15:21]  **redacted**.
[00:15:21 -> 00:15:23]  Let me repeat that for you, okay?
[00:15:23 -> 00:15:32]  It's **redacted**, and the number 9, right?
[00:15:32 -> 00:15:33]  Yes.
[00:15:33 -> 00:15:34]  Okay, great.
[00:15:34 -> 00:15:39]  Now there's an option of unattended access.
[00:15:39 -> 00:15:40]  Check mark on it.
[00:15:40 -> 00:15:46]  Yes, okay.
[00:15:46 -> 00:15:51]  Yeah, now have a look on your keypad, okay?
[00:15:51 -> 00:15:57]  On a lower, left hand side, on a lower bottom, which key do you have?
[00:15:57 -> 00:16:01]  Control.
[00:16:01 -> 00:16:03]  Right next to that control.
[00:16:03 -> 00:16:04]  FN.
[00:16:04 -> 00:16:07]  And right next to FN there.
[00:16:07 -> 00:16:08]  Windows and ALT.
[00:16:08 -> 00:16:09]  Yeah.
[00:16:09 -> 00:16:12]  So you need to press, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.
[00:16:12 -> 00:16:18]  You need to press the window key and the letter R is in Romeo, okay?
[00:16:18 -> 00:16:22]  Okay.
[00:16:22 -> 00:16:23]  Now what you got?
[00:16:23 -> 00:16:28]  Well, the same little box pops up.
[00:16:28 -> 00:16:30]  It says something about run.
[00:16:30 -> 00:16:31]  Okay, make it empty.
[00:16:31 -> 00:16:33]  And it disappeared.
[00:16:33 -> 00:16:40]  Well, it went back to hop to disk executive.
[00:16:40 -> 00:16:41]  Make it empty then.
[00:16:41 -> 00:16:43]  Oh, make that box empty, okay?
[00:16:43 -> 00:16:44]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:16:44 -> 00:16:45]  Okay.
[00:16:45 -> 00:16:58]  And now type in there, M as in Mary, S as in Sam, I as in Indiana,
[00:16:58 -> 00:17:12]  N as in Nancy, F as in Frank, O as in Oscar, and the number 3 and the number 2.
[00:17:12 -> 00:17:14]  Oh, you have a dog in your home?
[00:17:14 -> 00:17:16]  That's pretty good.
[00:17:16 -> 00:17:17]  Yep.
[00:17:17 -> 00:17:18]  Yep.
[00:17:18 -> 00:17:19]  Now click on okay.
[00:17:19 -> 00:17:26]  Now you'll be getting system information, okay?
[00:17:26 -> 00:17:28]  There's a big box will be coming up.
[00:17:28 -> 00:17:29]  Yep.
[00:17:29 -> 00:17:33]  In which you can find out system model number.
[00:17:33 -> 00:17:35]  Do you see system model?
[00:17:35 -> 00:17:43]  There's option of system model, ma'am.
[00:17:43 -> 00:17:46]  It says OS name, version.
[00:17:46 -> 00:17:47]  I have.
[00:17:47 -> 00:17:49]  System name, manufacturer.
[00:17:49 -> 00:17:57]  I have system, hardware resources, component software environment.
[00:17:57 -> 00:18:00]  In the next one I have all these other things.
[00:18:00 -> 00:18:02]  Look on the middle of the screen, ma'am.
[00:18:02 -> 00:18:05]  You need to find out system model.
[00:18:05 -> 00:18:10]  Okay.
[00:18:10 -> 00:18:11]  Got it.
[00:18:11 -> 00:18:12]  Please go ahead.
[00:18:12 -> 00:18:13]  Yeah.
[00:18:13 -> 00:18:22]  The HP ENVYX36L Convertible 15N-ESOXXX.
[00:18:22 -> 00:18:23]  All right.
[00:18:23 -> 00:18:24]  Thank you so much.
[00:18:24 -> 00:18:25]  Yeah.
[00:18:25 -> 00:18:28]  Now there's an option of system SKU.
[00:18:28 -> 00:18:31]  That is a serial number.
[00:18:31 -> 00:18:33]  SKU.
[00:18:33 -> 00:18:35]  This next to it.
[00:18:35 -> 00:18:36]  Okay.
[00:18:36 -> 00:18:37]  Okay.
[00:18:37 -> 00:18:40]  Do you want me to click on the system model?
[00:18:40 -> 00:18:42]  No, I don't want to click on it, ma'am.
[00:18:42 -> 00:18:43]  No.
[00:18:43 -> 00:18:45]  I want you to read it to me.
[00:18:45 -> 00:18:47]  System SKU.
[00:18:47 -> 00:18:49]  Okay.
[00:18:49 -> 00:18:50]  Are you ready?
[00:18:50 -> 00:18:51]  Yeah.
[00:18:51 -> 00:18:53]  **redacted**.
[00:18:53 -> 00:18:55]  **redacted**.
[00:18:55 -> 00:18:56]  **redacted**.
[00:18:56 -> 00:18:59]  **redacted**.
[00:18:59 -> 00:19:01]  **redacted**.
[00:19:01 -> 00:19:05]  And then that must be the pound mark.
[00:19:05 -> 00:19:09]  **redacted**.
[00:19:09 -> 00:19:10]  All right.
[00:19:10 -> 00:19:11]  Thank you so much.
[00:19:11 -> 00:19:15]  Now what I'll do here, as I got to know about all the things, I'm just going to go ahead
[00:19:15 -> 00:19:17]  and have a look on the system.
[00:19:17 -> 00:19:21]  I'm going to check your records, and if I found something, I'll do let you know, ma'am,
[00:19:21 -> 00:19:22]  okay?
[00:19:22 -> 00:19:26]  And I'm also going to check the warranties of your computer, like do we have a warranty here
[00:19:26 -> 00:19:27]  now.
[00:19:27 -> 00:19:31]  That will be easier to us to go ahead and help you with everything, okay?
[00:19:31 -> 00:19:36]  And it's going to take like five to ten minutes, ma'am, to go ahead and check all that.
[00:19:36 -> 00:19:39]  So can you put your call and hold for five minutes?
[00:19:39 -> 00:19:42]  Will that be okay for you?
[00:19:42 -> 00:19:43]  Okay.
[00:19:43 -> 00:19:44]  All right.
[00:19:44 -> 00:19:45]  Thank you so much.
[00:19:45 -> 00:19:48]  Please stay on the line, as it's going to take a little while.
[00:19:48 -> 00:19:52]  And if you want to have something like tea, coffee, wine, you can have it, and make yourself
[00:19:52 -> 00:19:55]  comfortable, ma'am, okay?
[00:19:55 -> 00:19:57]  All righty.
[00:19:57 -> 00:19:58]  All right.
[00:19:58 -> 00:19:59]  Thank you so much.
[00:19:59 -> 00:20:00]  Please stay on the line.
[00:20:00 -> 00:22:40]  Thanks.
[00:26:56 -> 00:26:57]  All right.
[00:26:57 -> 00:26:58]  Thank you so much for staying connected.
[00:26:58 -> 00:26:59]  Are you there with me?
[00:26:59 -> 00:27:05]  For what?
[00:27:05 -> 00:27:06]  Thank you for staying connected.
[00:27:06 -> 00:27:08]  Are you there with me?
[00:27:08 -> 00:27:09]  Yes.
[00:27:09 -> 00:27:11]  I'm still here.
[00:27:11 -> 00:27:12]  All right, ma'am.
[00:27:12 -> 00:27:14]  So I just tried to check all the things from my end.
[00:27:14 -> 00:27:19]  As I told you right now, it could be possible that it's kind of a security breach.
[00:27:19 -> 00:27:22]  So that is what we are having right now, okay?
[00:27:22 -> 00:27:25]  This is a clear case of a security breach.
[00:27:25 -> 00:27:30]  Right now, people are trying to get into your entire home network, okay?
[00:27:30 -> 00:27:34]  They're trying to use your old devices and everything.
[00:27:34 -> 00:27:35]  Got it, ma'am?
[00:27:35 -> 00:27:36]  That's the main call.
[00:27:36 -> 00:27:38]  Don't they have anything else to do?
[00:27:38 -> 00:27:40]  Sorry?
[00:27:40 -> 00:27:43]  I said, don't they have anything else to do?
[00:27:43 -> 00:27:45]  Well, that I don't know, you know.
[00:27:45 -> 00:27:55]  Well, I don't have anything on there that they can use.
[00:27:55 -> 00:27:58]  I don't have that money in my account.
[00:27:58 -> 00:28:00]  I do understand, ma'am.
[00:28:00 -> 00:28:03]  That's why I'm helping you with that, okay?
[00:28:03 -> 00:28:04]  Because they don't need your money.
[00:28:04 -> 00:28:06]  They don't need anything.
[00:28:06 -> 00:28:08]  They need your identity, okay?
[00:28:08 -> 00:28:10]  So why are they doing it?
[00:28:10 -> 00:28:11]  That's what I'm saying, ma'am.
[00:28:11 -> 00:28:15]  They want your identity so that they can use your information, okay?
[00:28:15 -> 00:28:17]  Let's suppose they got your social security.
[00:28:17 -> 00:28:22]  So whatever the money that you are getting on your social security, they can get it anytime.
[00:28:22 -> 00:28:24]  And you are not aware of it, okay?
[00:28:24 -> 00:28:29]  They can use your information to do, you know, some kind of criminal activities.
[00:28:29 -> 00:28:31]  It could be anything, ma'am, you know?
[00:28:31 -> 00:28:35]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:28:35 -> 00:28:47]  So you don't have to be worried.
[00:28:47 -> 00:28:50]  As I told you, we will go ahead and check, like, what is going wrong,
[00:28:50 -> 00:28:53]  so that I can help you with these and everything, okay?
[00:28:53 -> 00:28:57]  Got it, ma'am?
[00:28:57 -> 00:28:58]  Yeah.
[00:28:58 -> 00:29:13]  So first of all, we have to go ahead and check all the things.
[00:29:13 -> 00:29:19]  I want you to have, you know, grab a pen and paper so that I can provide you my information,
[00:29:19 -> 00:29:23]  so that you will be having all the information, okay?
[00:29:23 -> 00:29:24]  All right?
[00:29:24 -> 00:29:26]  Hold on a minute.
[00:29:26 -> 00:29:27]  Sure, no problem.
[00:29:27 -> 00:29:41]  Okay.
[00:29:41 -> 00:29:51]  Are you still there?
[00:29:51 -> 00:29:52]  I am.
[00:29:52 -> 00:29:54]  You can write down my name.
[00:29:54 -> 00:29:56]  My name is Spencer Riley, okay?
[00:29:56 -> 00:30:01]  Riley?
[00:30:01 -> 00:30:02]  R-I-L-E-Y?
[00:30:02 -> 00:30:05]  Yes, R-I-L-E-Y, yeah.
[00:30:05 -> 00:30:07]  You can write down my extension number.
[00:30:07 -> 00:30:13]  That is 6014.
[00:30:13 -> 00:30:19]  6014?
[00:30:19 -> 00:30:20]  Yeah.
[00:30:20 -> 00:30:23]  Got it.
[00:30:23 -> 00:30:26]  Can you spell that out to your full first and last name, ma'am, once again?
[00:30:26 -> 00:30:29]  Vesta.
[00:30:29 -> 00:30:31]  V as in Victor.
[00:30:31 -> 00:30:33]  **redacted**
[00:30:33 -> 00:30:35]  **redacted**
[00:30:35 -> 00:30:37]  **redacted**
[00:30:37 -> 00:30:38]  **redacted**
[00:30:38 -> 00:30:40]  **redacted**
[00:30:40 -> 00:30:41]  **redacted**.
[00:30:41 -> 00:30:42]  What is the last name?
[00:30:42 -> 00:30:44]  **redacted**.
[00:30:44 -> 00:30:46]  **redacted**.
[00:30:46 -> 00:30:47]  **redacted**.
[00:30:47 -> 00:30:49]  **redacted**.
[00:30:49 -> 00:30:53]  **redacted**.
[00:30:53 -> 00:30:55]  **redacted**.
[00:30:55 -> 00:30:59]  **redacted**.
[00:30:59 -> 00:31:02]  **redacted**.
[00:31:02 -> 00:31:04]  **redacted**.
[00:31:04 -> 00:31:05]  That's a good name.
[00:31:05 -> 00:31:12]  All right.
[00:31:12 -> 00:31:15]  I've had it for about 55 years.
[00:31:15 -> 00:31:17]  That was great.
[00:31:17 -> 00:31:20]  And what is the best number to call you?
[00:31:20 -> 00:31:24]  In case we got disconnected, I can call you.
[00:31:24 -> 00:31:29]  7**redacted**.
[00:31:29 -> 00:31:35]  7**redacted**, right?
[00:31:35 -> 00:31:40]  And this is like a landline or?
[00:31:40 -> 00:31:42]  It's a cell phone.
[00:31:42 -> 00:31:45]  Okay, do we have a landline number?
[00:31:45 -> 00:31:47]  No.
[00:31:47 -> 00:31:50]  All right.
[00:31:50 -> 00:31:55]  So now what you got to do here, we need to go ahead and check everything for you because
[00:31:55 -> 00:32:00]  whenever you run a scan on your computer, ma'am, we got to know the hacker also trying to get
[00:32:00 -> 00:32:02]  into your banking and all this stuff, okay?
[00:32:02 -> 00:32:07]  So first of all, we need to go ahead and check if everything is secure or not, okay?
[00:32:07 -> 00:32:09]  Got it, ma'am?
[00:32:09 -> 00:32:19]  So I want you to please open your Microsoft Edge or any browser that you generally use, okay?
[00:32:19 -> 00:32:21]  Any browser that I bought?
[00:32:21 -> 00:32:23]  That you generally use?
[00:32:23 -> 00:32:36]  Well, am I supposed to do it on these two columns of names?
[00:32:36 -> 00:32:38]  No, no. I'm telling you which browser.
[00:32:38 -> 00:32:42]  Like you use Google, you use Microsoft Edge.
[00:32:42 -> 00:32:43]  What do you use?
[00:32:43 -> 00:32:50]  Well, sometimes I use Google, sometimes I use MSN.
[00:32:50 -> 00:32:54]  Okay, you can open anything, ma'am, whatever you use, okay?
[00:32:54 -> 00:32:57]  I'll tell you how we're going to check all the things, all right?
[00:32:57 -> 00:33:05]  I don't see MSN on here.
[00:33:05 -> 00:33:10]  No, you don't have to, ma'am.
[00:33:10 -> 00:33:13]  Generally, I'm saying, okay, you don't have to look over there.
[00:33:13 -> 00:33:15]  It's not system information.
[00:33:15 -> 00:33:17]  Open any browser.
[00:33:17 -> 00:33:18]  Okay.
[00:33:18 -> 00:33:21]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:33:21 -> 00:33:23]  Do you have any of these on the right-hand side?
[00:33:23 -> 00:33:24]  Any of them?
[00:33:24 -> 00:33:29]  Ma'am, do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:33:29 -> 00:33:34]  I'm telling you to open browser, where you can go to Google.
[00:33:34 -> 00:33:38]  Hang on a minute.
[00:33:38 -> 00:33:44]  No problem.
[00:33:44 -> 00:33:58]  Okay.
[00:33:58 -> 00:34:00]  Okay, you got it?
[00:34:00 -> 00:34:01]  Okay, great.
[00:34:01 -> 00:34:06]  Now, I want you to have a look on the very right-hand side on the very top, ma'am.
[00:34:06 -> 00:34:08]  These are three dots, okay?
[00:34:08 -> 00:34:11]  Do you see dot, dot, dot?
[00:34:11 -> 00:34:12]  Yes.
[00:34:12 -> 00:34:16]  Click on that.
[00:34:16 -> 00:34:21]  Okay.
[00:34:21 -> 00:34:22]  Now, click on Settings.
[00:34:22 -> 00:34:23]  Where do you want me to go?
[00:34:23 -> 00:34:24]  Click on Settings.
[00:34:24 -> 00:34:29]  Okay.
[00:34:29 -> 00:34:34]  Yeah.
[00:34:34 -> 00:34:35]  Have you clicked on it, ma'am?
[00:34:35 -> 00:34:39]  Yeah.
[00:34:39 -> 00:34:40]  Okay, great.
[00:34:40 -> 00:34:42]  Now, what do you have?
[00:34:42 -> 00:34:44]  Tell me.
[00:34:44 -> 00:34:52]  I have a picture of the PCCU credit union statement.
[00:34:52 -> 00:34:55]  Well, how did you get it?
[00:34:55 -> 00:35:00]  It just popped up.
[00:35:00 -> 00:35:14]  Okay, close that, okay?
[00:35:14 -> 00:35:22]  It says an error occurred while processing your request.
[00:35:22 -> 00:35:24]  I don't even have that account.
[00:35:24 -> 00:35:25]  Okay.
[00:35:25 -> 00:35:26]  No problem.
[00:35:26 -> 00:35:32]  Click on that three dots once again, okay?
[00:35:32 -> 00:35:33]  All righty.
[00:35:33 -> 00:35:34]  Now, click on Settings.
[00:35:34 -> 00:35:39]  All righty.
[00:35:39 -> 00:35:40]  Okay, great.
[00:35:40 -> 00:35:43]  Now, go to the passwords.
[00:35:43 -> 00:35:46]  And now I will tell you how we can check, you know,
[00:35:46 -> 00:35:49]  your information is fake or not, okay?
[00:35:49 -> 00:35:51]  Have you clicked on the passwords, ma'am?
[00:35:51 -> 00:35:52]  Password?
[00:35:52 -> 00:35:53]  Yeah, passwords, yeah.
[00:35:53 -> 00:35:54]  I did.
[00:35:54 -> 00:35:57]  Now, if you see any of those, if you see the user name,
[00:35:57 -> 00:36:01]  the website, and the password, that means, ma'am,
[00:36:01 -> 00:36:05]  that information has been saved in the computer.
[00:36:05 -> 00:36:07]  So if the hacker will try to get into your computer,
[00:36:07 -> 00:36:09]  they have their old information.
[00:36:09 -> 00:36:11]  So tell me, what do you have?
[00:36:11 -> 00:36:13]  Do you see the user name and passwords?
[00:36:13 -> 00:36:17]  Well, the passwords aren't...
[00:36:17 -> 00:36:18]  They're not.
[00:36:18 -> 00:36:20]  Yeah, that means...
[00:36:20 -> 00:36:21]  Yeah.
[00:36:21 -> 00:36:24]  Okay, I'll tell you why that is like that, ma'am.
[00:36:24 -> 00:36:27]  That means that's not secure, okay?
[00:36:27 -> 00:36:29]  I'll tell you the reason.
[00:36:29 -> 00:36:31]  Like, if we are logging into something,
[00:36:31 -> 00:36:33]  we didn't log out properly, okay?
[00:36:33 -> 00:36:36]  What we do, we click on X.
[00:36:36 -> 00:36:39]  Like, let's suppose if I'm opening my bank account,
[00:36:39 -> 00:36:42]  I will not log out if I'm in a hurry.
[00:36:42 -> 00:36:44]  I'll simply log out.
[00:36:44 -> 00:36:46]  Like, I'll simply click on X.
[00:36:46 -> 00:36:48]  So we don't have to do that, okay?
[00:36:48 -> 00:36:50]  We have to log out properly.
[00:36:50 -> 00:36:52]  Like, if I'm opening my Amazon account,
[00:36:52 -> 00:36:54]  we have to sign in,
[00:36:54 -> 00:36:56]  and then we have to log out properly.
[00:36:56 -> 00:36:58]  That is a secure way to do all the things.
[00:36:58 -> 00:36:59]  You getting me?
[00:36:59 -> 00:37:03]  Okay.
[00:37:03 -> 00:37:07]  So that means that all the things are not secure right now.
[00:37:07 -> 00:37:09]  So what we're going to do first of all, ma'am,
[00:37:09 -> 00:37:12]  we have to go ahead and secure all the things, okay?
[00:37:12 -> 00:37:14]  All the important things.
[00:37:14 -> 00:37:16]  So what you have to do,
[00:37:16 -> 00:37:20]  you need to go ahead and sign in to your all the important things,
[00:37:20 -> 00:37:23]  and then you need to log out properly, okay?
[00:37:23 -> 00:37:26]  That's what you have to do, ma'am.
[00:37:26 -> 00:37:31]  You want me to click on these individual websites?
[00:37:31 -> 00:37:33]  Not individuals.
[00:37:33 -> 00:37:34]  Not individuals.
[00:37:34 -> 00:37:36]  Like, if there is something very important,
[00:37:36 -> 00:37:40]  like you do online banking, you can check your finances.
[00:37:40 -> 00:37:44]  If you do online shopping, you can check your shopping websites.
[00:37:44 -> 00:37:45]  Something is very important.
[00:37:45 -> 00:37:48]  You can check that, if everything is secure or not, okay?
[00:37:48 -> 00:37:53]  And if you're checking your account, you need to also check the statement.
[00:37:53 -> 00:37:57]  If you see any transaction that you didn't recognize,
[00:37:57 -> 00:38:00]  you need to let me know that, ma'am, okay?
[00:38:00 -> 00:38:01]  Well, that's what I asked you.
[00:38:01 -> 00:38:05]  Do I click on all these websites and...
[00:38:05 -> 00:38:08]  Yes, all the important things. Yeah, all the important things.
[00:38:08 -> 00:38:14]  Like you can check your finances and Amazon, everything, okay?
[00:38:14 -> 00:38:29]  Well, well, well. That's new.
[00:38:29 -> 00:38:37]  Sorry, big important.
[00:38:37 -> 00:38:40]  My computer is taking over itself and doing what it wants to do.
[00:38:40 -> 00:38:48]  I'm not getting you.
[00:38:48 -> 00:38:52]  I said this computer is doing whatever it wants to do.
[00:38:52 -> 00:38:55]  It went back to Microsoft Start.
[00:38:55 -> 00:38:57]  Oh, yeah, you can do that.
[00:38:57 -> 00:39:02]  Okay, you can check all the things, ma'am, if there is something very important.
[00:39:02 -> 00:39:05]  And then you need to log out properly, okay?
[00:39:05 -> 00:39:13]  That's what you have to do.
[00:39:13 -> 00:39:17]  Well, it ain't going.
[00:39:17 -> 00:39:27]  I'm not getting you. Repeat that, please.
[00:39:27 -> 00:39:33]  This thing pops up again that I first got on my computer.
[00:39:33 -> 00:39:37]  Now I have to sign into Chrome.
[00:39:37 -> 00:39:43]  No, you don't have to sign into Chrome, ma'am.
[00:39:43 -> 00:39:47]  I'm not doing anything. This is doing on its own.
[00:39:47 -> 00:39:50]  This sign came up that says restore page for Chrome.
[00:39:50 -> 00:39:51]  Okay, close that.
[00:39:51 -> 00:39:52]  Chrome didn't shut down correctly.
[00:39:52 -> 00:39:54]  Okay, okay, no problem. Close that.
[00:39:54 -> 00:39:59]  That's what I'm telling you. It's doing this on its own.
[00:39:59 -> 00:40:04]  Now it's got control remote desk thing up here now.
[00:40:04 -> 00:40:07]  Did you understand what I just told you right now, ma'am?
[00:40:07 -> 00:40:14]  I told you what's going on with this computer.
[00:40:14 -> 00:40:15]  No problem.
[00:40:15 -> 00:40:17]  It went to control remote desktop.
[00:40:17 -> 00:40:19]  No, no, you don't have to do that.
[00:40:19 -> 00:40:25]  What you have to do right now, you need to, you know, go to your important thing.
[00:40:25 -> 00:40:30]  You need to sign in, and then you need to log out properly, okay?
[00:40:30 -> 00:40:34]  That is a way to secure your old information, ma'am.
[00:40:34 -> 00:40:38]  And that's what I'm going to do right now right away, okay?
[00:40:38 -> 00:40:45]  So go to your important thing like your finances, like your Amazon, or if you do any shopping,
[00:40:45 -> 00:40:50]  you need to check everything is okay or not, or then you need to log out, okay?
[00:40:50 -> 00:40:53]  That's what you have to do, ma'am. Thank you.
[00:40:53 -> 00:41:03]  And once you are done, please let me know. I'm here for you, okay?
[00:41:03 -> 00:41:11]  I wish you were here.
[00:41:11 -> 00:41:13]  Sorry?
[00:41:13 -> 00:41:16]  I said I wish you were sitting in your seat.
[00:41:16 -> 00:41:17]  Thank you.
[00:41:17 -> 00:41:20]  Because all these things keep popping up.
[00:41:20 -> 00:41:28]  What is the thing popping up? I'm not getting you, ma'am.
[00:41:28 -> 00:41:37]  Well, in the left-hand corner I got a Yahoo app that I can click on and go to Yahoo.
[00:41:37 -> 00:41:42]  In the next box is MSN Outlook, Office and Skype.
[00:41:42 -> 00:41:45]  That's what I use as my home page is MSN.
[00:41:45 -> 00:41:46]  Okay.
[00:41:46 -> 00:41:52]  So here I am at MSN.
[00:41:52 -> 00:41:57]  You don't have to be on MSN, ma'am.
[00:41:57 -> 00:42:03]  What I'm saying, you need to log into your All The Important Things, and you need to log out properly.
[00:42:03 -> 00:42:04]  That's what I'm saying, ma'am.
[00:42:04 -> 00:42:51]  The phone is going to call me.
[00:42:51 -> 00:42:54]  Okay.
[00:42:54 -> 00:42:56]  No problem.
[00:42:56 -> 00:42:59]  If in case we got disconnected, I'll be giving you a call back, okay?
[00:42:59 -> 00:43:03]  You don't have to be worried about it.
[00:43:03 -> 00:43:04]  All righty.
[00:43:04 -> 00:43:05]  All right.
[00:43:05 -> 00:43:15]  Well, let's ask them for my password, and it won't let me put it in.
[00:43:15 -> 00:43:16]  It will.
[00:43:16 -> 00:44:09]  Try again.
[00:44:09 -> 00:44:10]  Okay.
[00:44:10 -> 00:44:11]  I'm on the app.
[00:44:11 -> 00:44:12]  Will you tell me to go now?
[00:44:12 -> 00:44:13]  X out?
[00:44:13 -> 00:44:14]  X about?
[00:44:14 -> 00:44:16]  No, that's what you don't have to do.
[00:44:16 -> 00:44:17]  You don't have to X out.
[00:44:17 -> 00:44:20]  You need to log out properly, okay?
[00:44:20 -> 00:44:22]  X out is the wrong way, okay?
[00:44:22 -> 00:44:24]  We don't have to do X out.
[00:44:24 -> 00:44:25]  We have to log out.
[00:44:25 -> 00:44:31]  It doesn't have a log out on here.
[00:44:31 -> 00:44:34]  Every banking app has a log out, ma'am.
[00:44:34 -> 00:44:39]  Well, not this one.
[00:44:39 -> 00:44:40]  Okay.
[00:44:40 -> 00:44:42]  Tell me which bank do you have.
[00:44:42 -> 00:44:44]  I can tell you where that log out is.
[00:44:44 -> 00:44:48]  First financial bank.
[00:44:48 -> 00:44:50]  First financial bank.
[00:44:50 -> 00:44:51]  Okay.
[00:44:51 -> 00:44:56]  Are you in the DAS mode on a main page, on a home screen?
[00:44:56 -> 00:44:57]  Yes.
[00:44:57 -> 00:44:59]  Okay, look on the left-hand side.
[00:44:59 -> 00:45:01]  You'll be having your name there.
[00:45:01 -> 00:45:03]  Left bottom.
[00:45:03 -> 00:45:06]  Nope.
[00:45:06 -> 00:45:10]  Well, yeah, on the original page, yeah, I got my name.
[00:45:10 -> 00:45:13]  On the lower left-hand side, on the lower bottom, there is your name.
[00:45:13 -> 00:45:14]  Click on that.
[00:45:14 -> 00:45:22]  There's an option of signing out on the lower bottom.
[00:45:22 -> 00:45:25]  That's the first time I've ever seen that.
[00:45:25 -> 00:45:26]  Here we go.
[00:45:26 -> 00:45:28]  But I told you, ma'am.
[00:45:28 -> 00:45:30]  Every bank can have a logout option.
[00:45:30 -> 00:45:32]  That is a secure way how we can do it, okay?
[00:45:32 -> 00:45:33]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:45:33 -> 00:45:35]  Well, they didn't tell me that was there.
[00:45:35 -> 00:45:36]  Okay, no problem.
[00:45:36 -> 00:45:38]  All righty, I've logged out on it.
[00:45:38 -> 00:45:39]  Okay, great.
[00:45:39 -> 00:45:42]  And do you have any other bank that you need to check?
[00:45:42 -> 00:45:43]  Any finances?
[00:45:43 -> 00:45:44]  Nope.
[00:45:44 -> 00:45:46]  Any investments, anything?
[00:45:46 -> 00:45:47]  Okay.
[00:45:47 -> 00:45:48]  Nope.
[00:45:48 -> 00:45:49]  Okay, great.
[00:45:49 -> 00:45:52]  And any other important thing that you have to check, ma'am?
[00:45:52 -> 00:45:54]  Like your shopping or anything?
[00:45:54 -> 00:45:55]  Okay.
[00:45:55 -> 00:45:56]  Nope.
[00:45:56 -> 00:45:58]  All right, no problem then.
[00:45:58 -> 00:46:00]  What you got to do now?
[00:46:00 -> 00:46:04]  First of all, you need to exit out from everything
[00:46:04 -> 00:46:08]  and just shut down your computer for two hours, okay?
[00:46:08 -> 00:46:09]  That's what you have to do.
[00:46:09 -> 00:46:12]  Hang on.
[00:46:12 -> 00:46:13]  No problem.
[00:46:13 -> 00:46:14]  Okay.
[00:46:14 -> 00:46:15]  I'm shutting down.
[00:46:15 -> 00:46:16]  Shut down, yeah.
[00:46:16 -> 00:46:17]  Okay, done.
[00:46:17 -> 00:46:25]  And leave it as it is for two hours, okay?
[00:46:25 -> 00:46:28]  And the problem will be fixed, ma'am.
[00:46:28 -> 00:46:31]  And if not, you can call me back directly, okay?
[00:46:31 -> 00:46:35]  All righty.
[00:46:35 -> 00:46:37]  All I have is just your extension number.
[00:46:37 -> 00:46:39]  Yeah, you have my name as well.
[00:46:39 -> 00:46:40]  So not to worry.
[00:46:40 -> 00:46:42]  Everything is working pretty good.
[00:46:42 -> 00:46:45]  We have removed all the hackers from the computer.
[00:46:45 -> 00:46:47]  Now we are on reading for all the things.
[00:46:47 -> 00:46:50]  As you check, everything is fixed, all right?
[00:46:50 -> 00:46:52]  There's nothing wrong with your banking and everything.
[00:46:52 -> 00:46:53]  Okay.
[00:46:53 -> 00:46:54]  Yeah.
[00:46:54 -> 00:46:55]  Okay.
[00:46:55 -> 00:46:56]  So that's good.
[00:46:56 -> 00:46:57]  That's pretty good.
[00:46:57 -> 00:47:03]  So you can just log out and wait for two hours, okay?
[00:47:03 -> 00:47:05]  I got a question.
[00:47:05 -> 00:47:06]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:47:06 -> 00:47:10]  I have a sister that's in the nursing home and I wanted to go visit with her.
[00:47:10 -> 00:47:13]  Would it be all right if I left this computer off longer?
[00:47:13 -> 00:47:14]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:14 -> 00:47:16]  Please go ahead.
[00:47:16 -> 00:47:17]  Okay.
[00:47:17 -> 00:47:19]  That would be really grateful, yeah.
[00:47:19 -> 00:47:22]  All right then.
[00:47:22 -> 00:47:23]  I'll get back.
[00:47:23 -> 00:47:25]  If you want, you can call me back.
[00:47:25 -> 00:47:28]  It's not done, but most probably your computer will be fixed, okay?
[00:47:28 -> 00:47:29]  So it's not too early.
[00:47:29 -> 00:47:30]  All right.
[00:47:30 -> 00:47:31]  All right.
[00:47:31 -> 00:47:32]  Thank you so much.
[00:47:32 -> 00:47:33]  All right then.
[00:47:33 -> 00:47:36]  It's been really lovely talking to you, lovely helping you, ma'am.
[00:47:36 -> 00:47:38]  Thank you for calling Microsoft.
[00:47:38 -> 00:47:39]  You have a pretty good day.
[00:47:39 -> 00:47:40]  Thank you.
[00:47:40 -> 00:47:41]  You too.
[00:47:41 -> 00:47:42]  Yeah.
```
