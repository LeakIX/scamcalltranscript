[00:17:44 -> 00:17:45]  Right?
[00:17:46 -> 00:17:47]  Yes.
[00:17:48 -> 00:17:49]  Thank you so much for that.
[00:17:50 -> 00:17:51]  Also, ma'am, I would like you to pass the soft credit check.
[00:17:52 -> 00:17:53]  Okay?
[00:17:54 -> 00:17:58]  Within that three to four working days, you refunded back 16 pounds in your account and company
[00:17:59 -> 00:18:01]  also providing you the complimentary gift right now.
[00:18:02 -> 00:18:03]  Okay?
[00:18:04 -> 00:18:07]  It's a Samsung tablet and Apple Watch, which is free of cost.
[00:18:08 -> 00:18:09]  You don't need to pay single penny for that gift.
[00:18:10 -> 00:18:11]  So, which gift do you want?
[00:18:12 -> 00:18:14]  It's a Samsung tablet or Apple Watch?
[00:18:15 -> 00:18:16]  I like the tablet.
[00:18:17 -> 00:18:18]  Samsung tablet.
[00:18:19 -> 00:18:20]  No problem.
[00:18:21 -> 00:18:22]  I can provide you the Samsung tablet.
[00:18:23 -> 00:18:24]  Okay?
[00:18:25 -> 00:18:28]  Within 54 to 48 hours, you receive all the papers, documents at your doorstep
[00:18:29 -> 00:18:31]  and the Samsung tablet at your doorstep.
[00:18:31 -> 00:18:32]  So, you have to pay **redacted**.
[00:18:33 -> 00:18:34]  Okay?
[00:18:35 -> 00:18:36]  Yeah, thank you.
[00:18:37 -> 00:18:38]  No problem.
[00:18:39 -> 00:18:40]  I'm going to completely turn from my side.
[00:18:41 -> 00:18:42]  Every next month, you are just paying 9 pounds.
[00:18:43 -> 00:18:44]  16 pounds bill is going to cancel.
[00:18:45 -> 00:18:46]  Okay?
[00:18:47 -> 00:18:48]  So, what I'm going to do now...
[00:18:49 -> 00:18:50]  Sorry?
[00:18:51 -> 00:18:52]  What about the other one?
[00:18:53 -> 00:18:54]  What about my second one, the 18 pounds?
[00:18:55 -> 00:18:56]  Okay.
[00:18:57 -> 00:19:00]  You want to discount on your second one number, right?
[00:19:01 -> 00:19:02]  Yes, please.
[00:19:03 -> 00:19:04]  Okay.
[00:19:05 -> 00:19:06]  I'm going to provide you discount on your second number.

[00:20:57 -> 00:20:58]  **redacted**
[00:20:59 -> 00:21:00]  Right.
[00:21:01 -> 00:21:02]  Okay.
[00:21:03 -> 00:21:04]  **redacted**
[00:21:05 -> 00:21:06]  Yep.
[00:21:07 -> 00:21:08]  **redacted**
[00:21:09 -> 00:21:10]  Yep.
[00:21:11 -> 00:21:12]  **redacted**
[00:21:13 -> 00:21:14]  Yep.
[00:21:15 -> 00:21:16]  **redacted**
[00:21:17 -> 00:21:18]  Yep.
[00:21:19 -> 00:21:20]  **redacted**
[00:21:21 -> 00:21:22]  Yep.
[00:21:23 -> 00:21:24]  **redacted**
[00:21:25 -> 00:21:26]  Yep.
[00:21:27 -> 00:21:28]  **redacted**
[00:21:29 -> 00:21:30]  Yep.
[00:21:31 -> 00:21:32]  **redacted**
[00:21:33 -> 00:21:34]  **redacted**
[00:21:35 -> 00:21:36]  Yeah.
[00:21:37 -> 00:21:38]  I'm going to repeat it back.
[00:21:39 -> 00:21:44]  It's **redacted**, right?
[00:21:45 -> 00:21:46]  Okay.
[00:21:47 -> 00:21:48]  Thank you.
[00:21:49 -> 00:21:50]  Okay.
[00:21:51 -> 00:21:54]  So then your expiry date on the log card is **redacted**, right?
[00:21:55 -> 00:21:56]  Yeah, **redacted**.
[00:21:57 -> 00:22:01]  Yeah, and 3 digits back of the card is **redacted**, right?
[00:22:02 -> 00:22:03]  Yes, that's correct.
[00:22:04 -> 00:22:10]  Yeah. So ma'am, just to stay on the line for a couple of 30 seconds, I can transfer this line to my supervisor, okay?
[00:22:11 -> 00:22:12]  Okay.
[00:22:12 -> 00:22:14]  Just for 30 seconds, stay on the line. Yeah, thank you so much.
[00:22:14 -> 00:22:15]  Thank you.
[00:22:16 -> 00:22:49]  Thank you so much for staying on the line. This is William. How are you?
[00:22:50 -> 00:22:54]  Sorry?
[00:22:55 -> 00:22:57]  Hi, ma'am. My name is William. How are you doing today?
[00:22:58 -> 00:23:00]  I'm fine, thank you.
[00:23:01 -> 00:23:05]  I wasn't expecting this call this early this morning, but...
[00:23:06 -> 00:23:07]  Oh, okay.
[00:23:08 -> 00:23:13]  The thing is that that is an unlimited time promotion and that is the reason you're getting this call.
[00:23:14 -> 00:23:21]  And you're also now, but I can see here, you need a discount on your another number elsewhere, right?
[00:23:22 -> 00:23:25]  Yes, I want to...
[00:23:27 -> 00:23:38]  Yes, I have two mobile phone accounts for Virgin and the other one which is £18, I want that reducing as well, if possible.
[00:23:39 -> 00:23:47]  Okay, it is possible, but I need to verify that the address that was registered with the bank is your previous one, right?
[00:23:48 -> 00:23:49]  Yes.
[00:23:49 -> 00:23:57]  Okay, all right, you didn't update your address with the bank or not?
[00:23:58 -> 00:24:02]  Sorry, I can't hear you very well, sorry.
[00:24:03 -> 00:24:08]  I was saying that did you update your address or not yet?
[00:24:08 -> 00:24:24]  I haven't got a full-time address at the moment. My **redacted** is actually a temporary accommodation.
[00:24:25 -> 00:24:37]  Okay, I was saying, ma'am, did you update the address with the bank where you're living right now or you're using the previous address for your mailing thing?
[00:24:38 -> 00:24:40]  No, it's going to my mum.
[00:24:41 -> 00:24:43]  Okay, it's going to be long.
[00:24:44 -> 00:25:04]  Yeah, the mail that I'll be getting from yourself can come here, but my card, the details you've been given to my card, that is registered at my mother's, not at **redacted**, not at **redacted**.
[00:25:05 -> 00:25:07]  That is registered with your mother, okay, got it.
[00:25:08 -> 00:25:29]  But the thing is that we need, the discount we just applied on your one account, but if you want the discount on your random number as well, then for that purpose rather we need to verify some details from your site, but with your address, with your address that is registered with the bank.
[00:25:30 -> 00:25:40]  With one bank account address, we are able to give you one discount, and the card is registered with your mom's address, right?
[00:25:41 -> 00:25:42]  Yes.
[00:25:43 -> 00:25:48]  Do you have any other card that is registered with your current address that you are leaving right now?
[00:25:48 -> 00:25:50]  No, I haven't.
[00:25:52 -> 00:25:54]  You didn't have, right?
[00:25:55 -> 00:25:58]  I have all my cards registered.
[00:26:00 -> 00:26:07]  The only reason my main account is registered with my mom is because I've moved addresses.
[00:26:07 -> 00:26:11]  Otherwise, it was at **redacted**.
[00:26:12 -> 00:26:23]  I got it. But the thing is that we are able to give you only one discount with one banking address, and that is registered with your mom's address.
[00:26:23 -> 00:26:44]  Leave it as it is for now, and then when I finally get my own address and then re-register my card to my own address, my new address, then I'll contact you back and see if I can get the same offer.
[00:26:44 -> 00:26:50]  Okay, that will be great. At that time I'll be happy to help you, okay?
[00:26:50 -> 00:26:52]  Okay, that's lovely.
[00:26:52 -> 00:27:07]  Alright, and the last thing I just need from your side is, we are going to refund the amount in your account and we also need to check that your account with the bank is active or not.
[00:27:07 -> 00:27:16]  So for that purpose, just keep that one thing in your mind, that there will be at least £35 will be available in your account, okay?
[00:27:16 -> 00:27:19]  Okay, that's fine. Thank you.
[00:27:19 -> 00:27:21]  Okay, thank you. Bye bye. Have a great day.
[00:27:21 -> 00:27:22]  Have a great day.
[00:27:22 -> 00:27:24]  Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye.
[00:27:24 -> 00:27:28]  Hello?
[00:27:28 -> 00:27:29]  Hello?
[00:27:29 -> 00:27:32]  Hi, are you Ms. **redacted**? Just stay on the line.
[00:27:32 -> 00:27:33]  Thank you.
[00:27:33 -> 00:27:35]  I nearly told you off because you said bye bye.
[00:27:35 -> 00:27:38]  Hi, just stay on the line, Ms. **redacted**.
[00:27:38 -> 00:27:40]  Thank you.
[00:27:40 -> 00:27:46]  Hi, yeah. Thank you so much for staying on the line. My name is **redacted**. How are you doing today?
[00:27:46 -> 00:27:48]  I'm fine, thank you.
[00:27:48 -> 00:27:50]  Oh, that was...
[00:27:50 -> 00:27:54]  The gentleman was supposed to. He said bye bye. So I nearly kicked you off.
[00:27:54 -> 00:27:58]  No, no, no. I'm really sorry for that. I'm really sorry for that.
[00:27:58 -> 00:28:02]  The thing is that my agent told me that... Oh, sorry for that.
[00:28:02 -> 00:28:08]  My agent told me that you want a more discount on other number as well. Am I right, ma'am?
[00:28:08 -> 00:28:14]  Yes, I'll do it. But because I'm in a temporary accommodation, he said I could only have one discount.
[00:28:14 -> 00:28:19]  Oh, like you want a discount on other number as well.
[00:28:19 -> 00:28:22]  I did, yes.
[00:28:22 -> 00:28:26]  Oh, like you don't have any other accommodation, any other address?
[00:28:26 -> 00:28:30]  No, no, no.
[00:28:30 -> 00:28:39]  Do you have any other bank account for that new discount to the other number?
[00:28:39 -> 00:28:41]  Do you have any other account, other bank account?
[00:28:41 -> 00:28:47]  No, well I have a credit card and a savings account, but they're both...
[00:28:47 -> 00:28:53]  You just have one account with the nationwide bank, you just have one account.
[00:28:53 -> 00:28:55]  You don't have any other bank account.
[00:28:55 -> 00:28:57]  No.
[00:28:57 -> 00:29:01]  Okay ma'am, then I can't give you the discount on other number as well.
[00:29:01 -> 00:29:02]  No, that's fine.
[00:29:02 -> 00:29:08]  You just have one accommodation, you just have one bank account, so that's why I can't give you discount on other number, okay?
[00:29:09 -> 00:29:12]  I think that everything on my site has been done.
[00:29:12 -> 00:29:16]  If you have any questions related to your promotional account, you can ask me.
[00:29:16 -> 00:29:19]  Everything has been done.
[00:29:19 -> 00:29:27]  Okay, I have a nationwide account, but I have three accounts nationwide.
[00:29:27 -> 00:29:34]  Alex, you have an account with the nationwide bank with your name.
[00:29:34 -> 00:29:36]  With your name, **redacted**.
[00:29:36 -> 00:29:37]  Yes.
[00:29:37 -> 00:29:46]  Alex, you don't have any account with any other bank like the Central Bank, Halifax Bank, any other bank.
[00:29:46 -> 00:29:48]  You just have one account.
[00:29:48 -> 00:29:52]  Yeah, I tried to get another bank account.
[00:29:52 -> 00:29:57]  I wanted to go with the **redacted**, a building society,
[00:29:57 -> 00:30:05]  but it kept growing out of my identity information, so it didn't work.
[00:30:05 -> 00:30:13]  But right now, you just have one account with the Nationwide Bank, right now.
[00:30:13 -> 00:30:16]  I do, yes, for now, yes.
[00:30:16 -> 00:30:21]  Then we are not able to give you discount on other numbers.
[00:30:21 -> 00:30:23]  No, that's fine, that's alright.
[00:30:23 -> 00:30:29]  You just have one accommodation, you just have one account, so that's why we are not able to give you.
[00:30:29 -> 00:30:35]  Anyways, if you have any questions related to your discount, you can ask me.
[00:30:35 -> 00:30:38]  Okay, that's fine.
[00:30:38 -> 00:30:42]  Okay ma'am, have a lovely day, you're such a nice cooperative lady.
[00:30:42 -> 00:30:46]  What a wonderful lady, have a lovely day, bye bye, take care, bye bye.
[00:30:46 -> 00:30:48]  Bye bye, yes, okay.
```
